His conclusion is the fact that there&#39;s a very serious challenge not less than another nine several weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be a chief medical officer who appears unlikely to back further easing of limitations and also to anticipate to propose tightening if that&#39;s the cost which needs to be compensated for that very important objective of getting children to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will children spread herpes to granny and grand daddy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Whitty mentioned it looked as if &quot;there&#39;s considerably less transmission from kids to adults than adults to adults&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He mentioned reopening schools would connect households diversely - for example by parents meeting in class gates, or mixing with others due to getting the power to return to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The actual fact of schools being open will likely lead to some increase in transmission but many of that&#39;s indirect,&quot; he mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are school staff at risk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data signifies that staff disbursing herpes with others of workers are &quot;maybe really more valuable than staff people catching it from pupils&quot;, Prof Whitty mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He mentioned that - much like other workplaces - &quot;it&#39;s staff uniting and disbursing it to one another&quot; that could drive infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Despite the most effective actions, you cannot take that [possibility of transmission] lower to zero and we&#39;re really apparent relating to this therefore we shouldn&#39;t pretend otherwise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Epidemiologist Prof Sian Griffiths told BBC Breakfast that returning school staff - and fogeys who is able to therefore go back to their workplace - should can remember the &quot;simple messages&quot; around hygiene, for instance washing hands regularly and covering sneezes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A couple of from the times when individuals ignore transmission are appropriate for instance inside the staff room, or possibly within the job canteen or possibly within the coffee room in the office... that&#39;s how a disease is spread in situations outdoors homes,&quot; she mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can schools be completely safe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Whitty mentioned the hazards may be minimised through getting hygiene and cleaning measures in place, but cautioned that as with every workplace, &quot;we can not repeat the danger will probably be taken lower to zero&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NASUWT teachers&#39; union mentioned the &quot;critical importance&quot; of social distancing and hygiene happen to be reinforced with the chief medical officers&#39; statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Country&#39;s Education Union accused the us government of letting lower pupils and teachers by missing a &quot;Plan B&quot; should there be a rise in infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It mentioned the us government needs to be seeking room, additionally to mobilising supply staff, allowing classes to keep safely if infections rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education Secretary Gavin Williamson mentioned ministers happen to be doing &quot;everything we could&quot; to help schools prepare to reopen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing inside the Sunday Occasions, he mentioned he preferred to reassure each parent and pupil that schools &quot;are ready on their own account&quot;, as well as the fall return to schools was &quot;more valuable than in the past&quot; this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Mr Williamson defended his decision to visit Scarborough days before the relieve A-level results in England, around 40% which are increasingly being altered following a initial grading system was scrapped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Williamson mentioned in the tweet that, because they visited family in Scarborough, he&#39;s at &quot;constant communication&quot; while using Department for Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helen Carter, deputy mind teacher at Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester, told BBC Breakfast that college would look &quot;different&quot; on her behalf pupils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She mentioned the school might have five separate entrances for each of the &quot;year group bubbles&quot;, which children will simply go to different classrooms for particular subjects for instance PE and technology and style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Carter mentioned she envisioned getting to help some parents the website &quot;can be as secure as you possibly can ensure it is, and youngsters need to go back to school&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s been a extended time, they need to re-engage their learning - in fact it is the issue of mental health. Children need to be throughout the classroom where teachers might be best placed to consider proper care of them that really help them increase the risk for progress they might require for learning,&quot; she mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should face coverings be worn in schools?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Scotland, where pupils returned to classrooms this month, there is critique from pupils and fogeys about safety safeguards and also the chance to keep social distancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus a school in Edinburgh has told pupils and staff to use face coverings whilst getting around between training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Earth Health Organization has mentioned children aged 12 well as over should placed on masks in line with national recommendations, citing evidence suggesting teenagers can infect others very much the same as adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children&#39;s minister Vicky Ford told Occasions Radio that kids &quot;should not ordinarily have to use goggles&quot; in class when they form small bubbles as well as other children, it&#39;s apparent who their close contacts are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s different when compared with example for anyone who is on trains and or else you lost in the shopping place, where you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re mixing with,&quot; she mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Inside the school setting, the children and youthful men and women be stored inside their consistent groups - meaning when there is a chapter, it might be very quickly managed.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>', 'Corona effects school, Childrens disturbed due to coroma', 'Coronavirus Missing school is worse than virus for kids - Whitty_1598281080.jpg', '2020-08-24 18:58:00', '2021-08-17 04:35:37'),

Carmakers have observed this fight over 4G and so are worried it&#39;ll cement the firm&#39;s position since the fight for dominance over 5G technology advances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is often a different world when compared with one [carmakers] are employed to, so that they are out of the blue faced with dealing with computer standards and computer patents, that&#39;s a serious issue on their own account simply because they don&#39;t have any. So when they have to start licensing these products, it will get pricey on their own account,&quot; Mr Moody told the BBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A patent can be a licence that confers the master the only real to supply an invention, as well as the sole to exclude others from making, using or selling that invention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The essential principle of patents is that you simply were built with a concept and people pay just you because you were built with a concept,&quot; he described.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The patent factor can be a final option strategy - whenever you do not get seem advice, you basically claim people owe you money for patents even though you aren&#39;t doing much with this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Mark Lemley of Stanford School is director in the Stanford Type in Law, Science.

Imbued with nostalgia, full of teenage boys at hamburger joints and diners plus wide-finned cars, donning white-colored-colored T-shirts and pomaded hair. The plots possess a inclination to focus on the folks walking into mischief of some sort, chasing women, bickering, and developing deep friendships typically, these films are situated against a wondrous soundtrack of doo-wop and rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll oldies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Most likely probably the most crazy film available?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The classic that&rsquo;s saved lives</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The reveal that uncovered our misogynistic culture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within individuals loose parameters, you are able to name Craig Levinson&rsquo;s fun-loving, digressive Diner (1982), or Francis Ford Coppola&rsquo;s superbly composed and mythic Rumble Fish (1983), or even George Lucas&rsquo;s West Coast-set coming-of-age story American Graffiti (1973). Less frequently name-checked but deeply beloved by those who understand it is Philip Kaufman&rsquo;s film The Wanderers, released in 1979, with different novel of the name by Richard Cost. Everything relating to this should have got an instantaneous classic: its raucous sense of humour, its spirited youthful cast, its soundtrack full of Frankie Valli earworms, which is realism along with romantic big-heartedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, within the summer time it had been released, it fell victim to less-than-fortuitous timing in the box office. A couple of several weeks prior, Walter Hill&rsquo;s completely different contemporary teen gang movie, The Players, came pelting into US cinemas. Feverish and brutal, it had been charged with stirring actual youth violence at cinemas round the nation, with scuffles as well as stabbings occurring in theatre lobbies. Kaufman stated, &ldquo;As a result, The Wanderers - which arrived on the scene soon after that - couldn&rsquo;t enter into lots of theatres.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The storyline is placed within the Bronx in 1963, starring a number of youthful actors who have been mostly first-timers and relative unknowns. At its center is Italian-American kid Richie (Ken Wahl) who is among the leaders of the greaser tribe named after their favourite Dion and also the Belmonts song. He and the pals (John Friedrich, Tony Ganios) enter into turf wars along with other outlandish gangs, such as the Fordham Baldies, enacting their senior high school sports rivalries within the roads. One of the voluble, hostile kids may be the littlest gang member, tomboy Peewee, performed through the outstanding child actor Linda Manz, who died earlier this year at age 58. She&#39;d become most widely known on her role because the youthful but world-weary narrator in Terrence Malick&rsquo;s Times of Paradise her toughness, finally revealed to become girding some major vulnerability, is among the most memorable areas of The Wanderers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wanderers captures, with sensitivity, a pivotal alternation in the culture and politics of america</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They call one another pricks with ears they terrorise the locals they play a (now deeply inappropriate) game known as &lsquo;elbow-tit&rsquo;, that is... pretty much exactly what you believe it&#39;s. This unbecoming introduction is when Richie meets Nina, an aspiration-girl music performer in the village (a youthful Karen Allen). The first rumblings of &lsquo;60s counterculture are happening within the next borough over, however it may as well perform another planet for Richie and the buddies. They spend time speaking to local mobsters in bowling alleys and dancing with women in basements, not chilling out at folk clubs. Thus, The Wanderers captures, with sensitivity, a pivotal alternation in the culture and politics of america.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film&rsquo;s director, Philip Kaufman, is definitely an eclectic US filmmaker whose career started with independent film Goldstein (1964). Kaufman continued to some distinguished Hollywood career, directing Westerns (The Truly Amazing Northfield Minnesota Raid), science-fiction (Invasion from the Body Snatchers) and modern literary adaptations (Henry &amp; June The Intolerable Lightness to be). His film about pioneering astronauts, The Best Stuff (1983), was nominated for eight Oscars. As Kaufman told BBC Culture by telephone, a scene in which the boys within the Wanderers discover the JFK murder was directly inspired because when he&#39;d experienced it in tangible existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were shooting in Chicago so we arrived on the scene from lunch having a small crew and camera. It had been most likely 3 or 4 men and a few actors - so we were about this boulevard. All of a sudden individuals are coming by crying and teary-eyed. We adopted them and moved into this store with all of these TVs on, there was the Kennedy murder. Which was something I kind of attempted to duplicate within the film with Richie - that very same mood and feeling - the tragedy. Music, politics, everything was altered for the reason that moment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lost masterpiece</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By turns warm, funny, and caustic, The Wanderers was revisited by critics decades later, and individuals were recently astonished by the things they found. Incidents where hailed it as being a &lsquo;lost masterpiece&rsquo;. But there have been other people who had harboured a real love for the film for a long time, making their very own burgundy-and-yellow bomber jackets the gang used. Carrying out a re-discharge of the show at Telluride Film Festival in 1996, Kaufman described his shock when, &ldquo;We were waiting in a square and all of a sudden 30 individuals Wanderers jackets came drained to surround us. Everyone who had been working in the festival had made their very own jackets - plus they counseled me Wanderers - they understood every line within the movie. And I&rsquo;ve been back a couple of occasions - plus they keep your tradition from the Wanderers alive, available online for within the mountain tops. And I had no clue!&rdquo;</p>', 'The Wanderers, age film', 'p08phyxk_1598611709.jpg', '2020-08-28 14:48:29', '2021-08-16 17:05:06'),

This season continues to be exactly the same, with a few seven million people affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I travelled through a few of the worst-hit districts, where heavy monsoons and inflamed rivers have taken away homes and livelihoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First Day, West Champaran</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first factor I observed while driving through Bihar&#39;s West Champaran district was the ton water lapping from the road on sides. Dirt houses, treetops and vast fields of rotting sugarcane counseled me submerged within the Burhi Gandak river, also known during these parts as Sikrahana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My shock in the devastation only increased after i arrived at my destination - a small village of 41 families known as Matiyar which had nearly drowned within the waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>17 from the people are Muslim, as the remaining are Dalit (formerly referred to as untouchables), who&#39;re in the cheapest rung of India&#39;s unyielding caste system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the families in Matiyar are impoverished. In them, they&#39;d gone to live in a skinny strip of road that ran with the village, fitting that which was left of the lives into small tarpaulin camping tents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youthful boys were showing one another videos of snakes that were wiped out - snake bites during heavy rains are typical in India, and lots of Indians die from their store each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While cooking potato curry on her group of six on the temporary brick stove, Nageena Devi explained that they stays awake the entire night watching for snakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They put on the tent sometimes and begin crawling over us when we&#39;re asleep. We&#39;re scared for the children therefore we spend the night time located on chairs, looking out on their behalf.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she was supportive for their plight. &quot;But which side these poor snakes go? In the center of this ton, they&#39;re as destitute once we are.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 2, East Champaran</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was before Bhawanipur, a village that were abandoned towards the roaring waters from the Gandak river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had been certainly one of seven villages that were engulfed around the nights 23 This summer once the embankment nearby broke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villagers had left their half-submerged homes and moved to the little bit of the embankment which was still standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 3, Darbhanga</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s National Highway 57 felt less just like a road and much more just like a bridge. The trainer told us the path used to be between fields dotted with houses, which were now under water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This specific highway was flooded by not just one however, many rivers - Sikrahana, Baagmati and Avdhara to mention a couple of. Agriculture remains the mainstay in Bihar, a fertile, flat land, drained by a number of rivers - a blessing that is another curse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, I saw countless black tarpaulin camping tents pitched in small clusters around the edges from the road. Here, villagers didn&#39;t fear venomous snakes. They stated their enemy was traffic. Just yesterday, a couple have been hurt within an accident, while sleeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pradeep Mehto compares his existence on the road to what dog. &quot;Much like dogs awaken in the smallest seem, we awaken. The entire night we&#39;re scared that the bus or truck will go beyond us.

Women would fetch water in one of just three hands pumps, while men walked their cattle round the camp. Refuse was thrown everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I visited the camp ground, the foremost and only meal during the day had been offered. People created rows for his or her share of the thick stew of pulses and grain that were cooked within the makeshift community kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They ate their meal from disposable plates, while relaxing in the dirty slush. My eyes were attracted for an seniors man who battled to swallow that which was on his plate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 5, Muzaffarpur</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I drove for the village of Singhai, I saw the floating tops of submerged temples, mosques, houses, fields and trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s the very first time in 40 years this a part of Muzaffarpur district has observed such massive floods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals who can afford to had left the village and gone to live in the district headquarters.

This way we steer clear of the largest breaking waves,&quot; he states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the Danish territory&#39;s remote North Atlantic location, Mr Gregarsen states the deep, nutrient-wealthy, waters are perfect for growing seaweed, having a stable temperature which is between 6C and 11C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His firm is one kind of a wave of seaweed farms which have popped up in Europe and The United States, spurred with a growing demand in the food industry yet others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve got a biomass you can use for food and feed, and replacing fossil-based items like packaging material from plastic,&quot; he states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mechanisation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seaweeds are fast-growing algae. They utilise energy from sunlight, and occupy nutrients and co2 in the seawater. Scientists suggest seaweed may help fight global warming and offset carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sea Rainforest lately won funding in the US United states doe to construct an identical system in California, where there&#39;s curiosity about developing industrialised seaweed production for future biofuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aboard the harvesting boat the skipper controls an analog arm that lifts lines in the water. The seaweed is chopped free, filling containers. It&#39;s quick but untidy work. The line is then left to regrow. This season about 200 tonnes is going to be harvested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the organization is scaling up, and intends to double its capacity this season. It is not earning money at this time, but expects to soon, Mr Gregarsen informs me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are able to observe how we are able to mechanise this, how the largest mtss is a really large-scale efficient activity,&quot; he states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are hardly any firms that do that like a lucrative business, or no.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cosmetics and medicines</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seaweed must be processed rapidly. In a small plant within the Faroese village of Kaldbak, machines clean the harvest. Some is dried and provided to food manufacturers. The remainder is fermented and shipped to animal feed producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most farmed seaweed is ingested in food, but extracts are utilized in a multitude of products. Whether it&#39;s tooth paste, cosmetics, medicines or commercial dog food, these frequently contain hydrocolloids produced from seaweed, that have gelling or thickening qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And much more goods are coming, along with other firms focusing on textiles and plastic alternatives, including biodegradable packaging, water capsules, and consuming straws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seaweed production has boomed. Between 2005 and 2015 volumes bending, surpassing Thirty Dollars million tonnes yearly, reports the UN&#39;s Food and Agriculture Organization. It is a business a bigger factor than $6bn (&pound;5bn) worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet only a part of cultivation happens outdoors Asia, where farming can be a extended-established, but mostly work-intensive activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;A great deal of effort&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The job cost is over the top in Europe, so that&#39;s one primary problem with it,&quot; explains Annette Bruhn, who&#39;s a senior investigator at Aarhus College in Denmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Plenty of effort should be place in mechanisation and upscaling.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To produce farming economical, she states &quot;the yield must increase as well as the cost must come down&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But farming systems aren&#39;t easily replicated. &quot;Different areas in a variety of waters, all require modifications. There is not one solution which may be prone to fit all,&quot; states Ms Bruhn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, she&#39;s hopeful, and states you will find &quot;many areas where one can have breakthroughs&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is exactly what innovators like Sintef are attempting to do. The Norwegian research group is focusing on technology to streamline farming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now the majority of the seaweed can be used for food, but later on you want to apply it fish feed, fertilisers, biogas. We want bulk and we have to produce considerably faster,&quot; states research researcher Silje Forbord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dry lab</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prototype machines like the &quot;seaweed spinner&quot; instantly wrap spools of seedling-transporting threads onto lines, ready for deployment at ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another concept, SPoke (Standardized Manufacture of Algae), includes circular farm modules where seaweed grows from lines radiating outwards. It&#39;s designed so a robotic can move across the wheel-like spokes - either attaching threads transporting juvenile seaweed or harvesting it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have built one arm having a robot going backwards and forwards. That&#39;s been tested inside a dry lab,&quot; explains Ms Forbord, but more investment is going to be needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms Abreu does not think accessibility to land is really a restricting factor. Former salt works and fish farms might be repurposed, she states, mentioning you will find hectares of availability in Portugal, France, Italia, A holiday in greece and Poultry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onshore seaweed farming happens in Canada and Nigeria too. Micro-algae will also be grown in tank systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are more challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The primary bottleneck is energy cost. Dealing with tanks you&#39;ll need the pumping and also the aeration to help keep water moving,&quot; states Ms Abreu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm can&#39;t survive on sales alone at this time. But Ms Abreu thinks the seaweed market continuously grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is a huge trend,&quot; she states. &quot;Each year there&#39;s increasingly more companies. You will find newcomers in most steps from the value chain.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Seaweed, foodstuff and fuel for future years', '_113789068_seaweed.landscape_1598729385.jpg', '2020-08-29 23:29:45', '2021-08-14 22:40:58'),

However, the coronavirus pandemic meant the campaign wound up finishing using the Champions League final on 23 August, 2 days before Messi let Barcelona know his intentions within an official way (more about that later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barca firmly believe time for him to declare need to leave has passed which the 33-year-old is contracted before the finish of 2020-21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lawyers is going to be licking their lips in anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Messi&#39;s side nothing has altered. He want to leave around the best terms possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barcelona have stated the gamer isn&#39;t for purchase - unless of course obviously someone thinks it&#39;s worth spending the 700m euros required to trigger his buyout clause at this time - and find out no reason in almost any further conferences for the time being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Messi doesn&#39;t wish to depart inside a bad way, not due to the board and surely due to the respect he&#39;s for that club as well as their fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of people have centered on the burofax delivered to tell Barcelona of his intention to depart, claiming it had been a disrespectful method of handing in the notice. It had been nothing like that. It had been confirmation - a kind of recorded delivery - that informed the club on paper what Messi had said excitedly verbally on numerous occasions since he stopped contract renewal negotiations around March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had been only a logical step on the way, having a meeting to try and arrange an amiable exit the following logical step. Messi&#39;s strategy continues to be unchanged throughout. The modification could be if he made the decision to visit war using the club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Argentine doesn&#39;t have intends to make any statements within the immediate future, definitely not while you may still find a lot of things to go over and things are up in mid-air. When things begin to relocate the best direction for him, Messi will be ready to explain his feelings, although not before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Players need to do their pre-season tests on Sunday after which training starts on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rumours Manchester City would be ready to let any regular starters go in return for Messi are way from the mark. Defenders Angelino or Eric Garcia could feature inside a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No club will probably be capable of paying a transfer fee of 100m euros plus Messi&#39;s salary, even considering his wages will disappear wherever he goes next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barcelona won&#39;t pay a swap of players they don&#39;t want anybody from City. They don&#39;t want to market and would only be ready to meet Messi to be able to renew his contract, to not negotiate a means out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone is positioning on obvious terms.

To his wife, Simone, especially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I inherited Marvel and also the Russo Brothers&#39; casting selection of T&#39;Challa. It&#39;s something which I&#39;ll forever appreciate. The very first time I saw Chad&#39;s performance as T&#39;Challa, it had been within an incomplete cut of Captain America: Civil War. I had been deciding whether directing Black Panther was the best choice for me personally. I&#39;ll always remember, relaxing in an editorial suite around the Disney Lot and watching his scenes. His first with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, then, using the South African cinema titan, John Kani as T&#39;Challa&#39;s father, King T&#39;Chaka. It had been at that time I understood I needed to create this movie. After Scarlett&#39;s character leaves them, Chad and John started conversing inside a language I&#39;d never heard before. It sounded familiar, full of the identical clicks and smacks that youthful black children will make in the usa. Exactly the same clicks that people would frequently be chided to be disrespectful or improper. But, it&#39;d a musicality into it that felt ancient, effective, and African.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within my meeting after watching the show, I requested Nate Moore, among the producers from the film, concerning the language. &quot;Did everyone recover it?&quot; Nate responded, &quot;That&#39;s Xhosa, John Kani&#39;s native language. He and Chad made the decision to complete the scene like this on set, so we folded by using it.&quot; I figured to myself, &quot;He just learned lines in another language, on that day?&quot; I could not conceive how difficult that has to happen to be, although I had not met Chad, I had been already in awe of his capacity as actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I learned later there was much conversation over how T&#39;Challa would seem within the film. The choice to have Xhosa function as the official language of Wakanda was solidified by Chad, a local of Sc, while he could learn his lines in Xhosa, there around the place. Also, he recommended for his character to talk with an African accent, to ensure that he could present T&#39;Challa to audiences being an African king, whose dialect was not overcome through the West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I finally met Chad personally at the begining of 2016, after i signed to the film. He snuck past journalists which were congregated for any press junket I had been doing for &quot;Creed,&quot; and met beside me within the eco-friendly room. We spoken about our way of life, time playing football attending college, and the time at Howard studying to become a director, about our collective vision for T&#39;Challa and Wakanda. We spoke concerning the irony of methods his former Howard classmate Ta-Nehisi Coates was writing T&#39;Challa&#39;s current arc with Marvel Comics. And just how Chad understood Howard student Prince Johnson, who&#39;s murder with a officer inspired Coates&#39; memoir Between Your World and Me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I observed then that Chad was an anomaly. He was calm. Assured. Constantly studying. But additionally kind, comforting, had the warmest laugh on the planet, and eyes that seen much beyond his years, but tend to still sparkle just like a child seeing something the very first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which was the very first of numerous conversations. He would be a particular someone. We&#39;d frequently talk about heritage and just what this means to become African. While preparing for that film, he&#39;d ponder every decision, every choice, not only for the way it might think about themself, but exactly how individuals choices could reverberate. &quot;They not prepared for this, what we should are doing&hellip;&quot; &quot;This really is The Exorcist, this really is Lord from the Rings, however for us&hellip; and larger!&quot; He&#39;d say this in my experience basically we were battling to complete an impressive scene, stretching into double overtime. Or as they was covered in body paint, doing their own stunts. Or crashing into frigid water, and foam landing pads. I&#39;d nod and smile, however i did not believe him. I had no clue when the film works. I wasn&#39;t i understood things i was doing. However I think back and understand that Chad understood something all of us did not. He was playing the lengthy game. All while investing in the job. And work he did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&#39;d arrived at auditions for supporting roles, which isn&#39;t common for lead actors in big budget movies. He was there for many M&#39;Baku auditions. In Winston Duke&#39;s, he switched a chemistry read right into a wrestling match. Winston broke his bracelet. In Letitia Wright&#39;s audition for Shuri, she pierced his royal poise together with her signature humour, and will bring in regards to a smile to T&#39;Challa&#39;s face which was 100% Chad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While filming the film, we&#39;d meet in the office or inside my rental home in Atlanta, to go over lines and new ways to add depth to every scene. We spoken costumes, military practices. He stated in my experience &quot;Wakandans need to dance throughout the coronations. When they just stand there with spears, what separates them from Romans?&quot; At the begining of drafts from the script. Eric Killmonger&#39;s character would ask T&#39;Challa to become hidden in Wakanda. Chad challenged might requested, &quot;Let&#39;s say Killmonger requested to become hidden elsewhere?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chad deeply valued his privacy, and that i wasn&#39;t aware of the facts of his illness. After his family released their statement, I realized he was coping with his illness the whole time I understood him. While he would be a caretaker, an innovator, along with a man of belief, dignity and pride, he shielded his collaborators from his suffering. He resided an attractive existence. And that he made great art. Every single day, every year. Which was who he was. He was a legendary firework display. Let me tell tales about being there for a few of the brilliant sparks &#39;till the finish of my days. How much of an incredible mark he&#39;s left for all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve not grieved a loss of revenue this acute before. I spent the this past year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to state, that people were not determined to see. It leaves me damaged understanding that I will not have the ability to watch another close-from him within the monitor again or walk as much as him and request another take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It hurts more to understand that people can&#39;t have another conversation, or Facetime, or text exchange. He&#39;d send vegetarian recipes and eating regimens in my family and me to follow along with throughout the pandemic. He&#39;d sign in on me and my children, even while he worked using the scourge of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In African cultures, we frequently make reference to family members which have handed down as ancestors. Sometimes you&#39;re genetically related. Sometimes you aren&#39;t. I&#39;d the privilege of directing scenes of Chad&#39;s character, T&#39;Challa, contacting the ancestors of Wakanda. I was in Atlanta, within an abandoned warehouse, with bluescreens, and large movie lights, but Chad&#39;s performance managed to get feel real. It was because from the moment which i met him, the ancestors spoke through him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s really no secret in my experience just how he could skilfully portray a lot of our noticably ones. I&#39;d without doubt he would survive and then bless us with increased. But it&#39;s having a heavy heart and a feeling of deep gratitude to possess have you been in the presence, that I must reckon with the truth that Chad is definitely an ancestor now. And That I know that he&#39;ll keep an eye on us, until we meet again.</p>', 'Chadwick Boseman, Black Panther', '_114181817_gettyimages-915964024_1598819006.jpg', '2020-08-31 00:23:26', '2021-08-17 11:32:59'),

You warned us!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Siberian arctic wildfires set a record this summer. According to the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, an 18-month magazine will cause more air pollution than any other in a month. In part, it has evolved into hot, resinous boreal forests, swampy peat and melting tundra ice sheets that emit high concentrations of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere along with toxic pollutants such as methane and mercury. But that&#39;s also because fires are more widespread and a by-product of the record heatwave that hit the Arctic in early summer. This melts the tundra and is much easier to burn. However, small light soot particles also enter with the gases emitted by forest fires. These &quot;particulate matter&quot; (PM) are a common component of urban air pollution, from which exhaust gases and heavy industry can be emitted. After all, the smoke from a forest fire can cause serious damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, during the bushfire season in Canada, cities in British Columbia saw 20 times more dust particles than the daily average. Sarah Henderson, Senior Fellow at the Center for Disease Control in British Columbia, said: &ldquo;The small size and large number of dust particles have a lot to do with this. Wood fires tend to produce more fine dust particles than PM2. This is because even the finer nanoparticles, which are known to be extremely harmful to health, are generally small enough to see tiny particles 30 times the width of a human hair, and when inhaled, they can penetrate the lining of the lungs. and damage the airways. ...</p>', 'wildfire pollution, health', 'p08p8gjv_1598879978.jpg', '2020-08-31 17:19:38', '2021-08-10 20:21:26'),

The average American counts about 40 pounds of clothing each year. Worldwide, about 92 million tonnes of textile waste are generated each year, and every second the equivalent of a garbage truck full of clothes ends up in landfills. By 2030, more than 134 million tonnes of textiles are expected to be dumped annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The current fashion system uses a large number of non-renewable resources, including oil that is made to make clothes and is often used only for a short time. After that, most of the material is lost to landfills or incinerators,&quot; said Chetna Prajapati, who studies ways to Make sustainable textiles at Loughborough University in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This system depresses valuable resources such as water, pollutes the environment and damages ecosystems, and creates global social impacts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are good reasons to look for alternatives to dumping clothes in the trash - the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Textile production alone causes 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere every year. Large amounts of water are also used to make our clothing, and the fashion industry is responsible for 20% of the world&#39;s wastewater. (Read more about the impact our fashion addiction has on the planet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, we are buying more clothes than ever before - the average consumer is buying 60% more clothes now than we were 15 years ago. The UK buys more than two tonnes of clothing every minute, more than any other country in Europe. Approximately 56 million tonnes of clothing are purchased worldwide each year, which will increase to 93 million tonnes by 2030 and 160 million tonnes by 2050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, only 12% of the materials used in clothing are recycled worldwide<br />\r\nWhile most carefree clothing will last for years, a change in fashion means that changing consumer tastes will artificially shorten their lifespan. Industry data shows that modern clothing will last 2 to 10 years, with underwear and t-shirts last only one to two years while suits and coats last about four to six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does recycling our clothes help lower the tax our fashion addictions impose on the environment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, only 13.6% of the clothing and shoes discarded in the United States are recycled - while the average American throws away 37 kg of clothing each year. Finally, only 12% of the materials used in clothing are recycled worldwide. Compare that to paper, glass, and plastic PET bottles, which have recycling rates of 66%, 27% and 29%, respectively, in the US, and it&#39;s clear that clothing is lagging behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, most of the recycled polyester used by the top fashion brands today comes from bottles, not used clothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the problem depends on the material of our clothing. The fabric we cover on our bodies is an intricate combination of fibers, bodies and accessories. They are made from a problematic mixture of natural yarns, man-made fibers, plastics and metals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For example, 100% cotton t-shirts contain many other components such as labels and sewing threads, which are usually made from a different material such as polyester,&quot; Prajapati said. &quot;Likewise, typical jeans made of cotton thread, which is usually blended with spandex, as well as other components such as zippers and buttons and polyester sewing thread that are dyed with various dyes.&quot;</p>', 'Clothes Recycling, How clothes are recycled?', 'p08kds9r_1598892255.jpg', '2020-08-31 20:44:15', '2021-08-18 02:12:18'),

The hope is that they will save us from the worst effects of climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is everywhere. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg made a film arguing for the added protection of the world&#39;s forests and replanting felled trees. George Monbiot, a British Guardian columnist, has launched a campaign called Natural Climate Solutions to help restore forests and other ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&#39;t just a conversation. The UK government has planted millions of trees over the past decade and has pledged millions more between 2020 and 2024. Others have attempted a much more dramatic achievement: in 2016, the state of India planted 50 million trees in one day. Last July, Ethiopia said it was planting 350 million a day. Even the UK&#39;s Daily Mail, a far-right newspaper unfamiliar with its climate activity, has just launched a campaign to encourage all its readers to plant trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also like ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you bring the forest back to life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would happen if all the trees disappeared?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is It Wrong to Expect Climate Change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protecting existing forests and planting new ones is certainly a good thing. But scientists say we shouldn&#39;t trust trees too much to save ourselves. Last year in particular, the research team said we could plant an additional trillion trees and remove a quarter of the carbon dioxide currently in the air. These figures have been widely criticized for being exaggerated and unreliable. Trees will definitely help us slow down climate change, but they will not reverse it on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main problem is that our society emits greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), which heats the Earth&#39;s climate to levels we&#39;ve never seen before. As a result, large ice sheets are melting and causing sea levels to rise, and extreme weather events such as storms and droughts are becoming more severe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution is to stop the emission of all greenhouse gases, for example by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources such as solar energy. Deforestation is actually one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide because when trees are cut down, much of the carbon stored in them is released into the air - especially if the wood is burned. For example, land use change - especially deforestation - contributed four billion tonnes of CO2 emissions to a total of 41 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2017. In other words, if we stopped cutting down trees, we would reduce annual emissions by about 10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is no longer enough to just stop all of our emissions. At this point we have emitted so much CO2 and left emission reductions so late that we are almost certain that we will miss our target of limiting warming to 1.5 &deg; C or 2 &deg; C. This means we also need to find ways to actively eliminate.

It can be Mach 4.5 which is easier physics,&quot; says Mr Dissel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At those kinds of speeds you could fly from London to Sydney in four hours or Los Angeles to Tokyo in two hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, most research into hypersonic flight is not for civil aviation.

And Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) also re-enter the atmosphere at very high hypersonic speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now rival powers are striving to create weapons that can stay within the atmosphere, without needing to utilise the cooling properties of outer space, and that can be manoeuvred - unlike a static ICBM aimed at a city - towards a target that might be moving itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Carrier-killers</strong><br />\r\nMilitary spending is driving the hypersonic push by the three big national players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent Pentagon media briefing Mike White, assistant director for hypersonics in the US military, talked about development being driven by &quot;our great power competitors and their attempts to challenge our domain dominance&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accuracy is a major challenge for this hypersonic missile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Possession of hypersonic missiles, called &quot;carrier killers,&quot; could force US carriers to move away from China&#39;s Pacific coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, hitting a nuclear-powered carrier traveling at speeds of 30 knots or more (35 miles per hour or 56 km / h) requires fine adjustments to the rocket heading which is difficult to achieve at Mach 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heat generated around the rocket shell creates plasma or gaseous matter at supersonic speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can block signals received from external sources such as communications satellites, and can blind internal guidance systems that are trying to locate moving objects outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plasma only accumulates where the highest temperatures are found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cone-shaped missile has a flat plasma layer, but the missile that looks like an elegant wing arrow can repel this plasma screen from the surface with the most refined antennae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shark cheeks</strong><br />\r\nAs if hypersonic flight wasn&#39;t difficult enough, chemical dissociation added to the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At extreme speeds and temperatures, this phenomenon causes oxygen molecules to break down into their atoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This in turn complicates the chemical model on which every air breathing machine is based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advances in the hypersonic arms race have been dramatic. In 2010, the United States flew a shark-jaw drone over parts of the Pacific Ocean for five minutes at hypersonic speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is more than pure speed. It is time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five minutes may not sound like a long flight, but it is a victory when it comes to overcoming supersonic obstacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This high-speed engine, the X-51A, was shot down by the high-flying B-52 bomber and hit Mach 4.5 with rocket boosters before starting the main engine.<br />\r\nKnown as a scramjet, this engine combines airflow with jet fuel in a serrated inlet to accelerate to supersonic speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means dealing with the temperature of the air entering the inlet at 1000 &deg; C for several minutes. Finally, four X-51As departed on a one-way trip across the Pacific between 2010 and 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shock wave</strong><br />\r\nAerojet Rocketdyne is a space engine and rocket engine specialist in California working on the X-51A. The level of confidentiality associated with this technology is that even seven years after the project ended, employees were simply speaking anonymously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hypersonic expert for the company told the X-51A, &quot;The really hot engine part is up front, where the shock waves are forming, so that&#39;s where the material investment flows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that much was learned from the X-15 rocket aircraft and subsequent space shuttle programs in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Reaction Engine is now demonstrating a process that will allow its air motor to absorb superheated hypersonic air without a hiccup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His Saber had what he called &quot;pre-cooling&quot;. It is the first part of the engine to collide with hot, angry hypersonic air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the challenge is to mix with fuel to create traction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hot like lava</strong><br />\r\nThe Saber engine underwent an intensive test mode at the Colorado facility in October 2019, where the reaction engine had to find a way to reproduce hypersonic flight speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company took the supersonic engine, installed it, and directed the exhaled air from behind into the Saber engine entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pre-cooling the Saber does its job by injecting coolant into the system under high pressure and allowing the Saber to mix this air with the fuel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The materials needed here are not easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shuttle relies on high-temperature composite tiles to protect it from re-entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere. However, this requires extensive technical support, which is impractical for commercial traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative approach is to use a nickel alloy called Inconel, which can handle a stream of air, which is heated to the same intensity as a lava flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Dissel, Reaction Engines are now taking the Inconel alloy line. &quot;This is where we are now and there are also cooling channels for extracting heat,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advanced thermal management system combined with Inconel shows the way to the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hypersonic guide</strong><br />\r\nIf this combination works, the vision of paying for passengers on hypersonic flights could become a reality in 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential for hypersonic travel to allow VIPs to arrive with maximum impact was discovered by the US Air Force&#39;s Presidential Aircraft Division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hired Atlanta-based hypersonic launch company Hermeus to evaluate the Mach 5 transport design, which can carry up to 20 passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that one day the President of the United States could join the highly defensive group of Mach 5 travelers.</p>', 'AirCraft, Rival, Leadership', 'Hypersonic aircraft_1599248102.jpg', '2020-09-04 23:35:02', '2021-08-14 22:40:46'),

That way we avoid the biggest break from the waves,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite Denmark&#39;s remote location in the North Atlantic, according to Gregarsen, the nutrient-rich deep waters are suitable for growing algae with stable temperatures between 6 &deg; C and 11 &deg; C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His company is part of a wave of algal farming that is emerging in Europe and North America, driven by growing demand from the food and other industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They have biomass that can be used for food and feed, replacing fossil products as plastic packaging materials,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>mechanization<br />\r\nAlgae are fast growing algae. They use energy from sunlight and absorb nutrients and carbon dioxide from seawater. Scientists suggest that algae could help fight climate change and offset carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocean Rainforest was recently funded by the US Department of Energy to build a similar system in California, where there is interest in developing industrial algae production for future biofuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a classic car, the captain controls a mechanical arm that lifts the rope out of the water. Algae are cut freely by filling the container. It&#39;s a fast, messy job. The lines are then allowed to grow. This year, around 200 tonnes will be harvested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the company is growing and plans to double its capacity this year. No money has yet been made, but it&#39;s expected soon, Mr said. Gregarsen to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can see how we can mechanize this, how we can make this a very effective activity on a large scale,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not many companies are doing this as a profitable business if anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cosmetics and medicine<br />\r\nAlgae need to be processed quickly. In a small factory in Faroe village in Kaldbak, harvesting machines. Some are dried and sent to food factories. The remainder is fermented and sent to animal feed producers.<br />\r\nMost agricultural algae are consumed with food, but their extracts are used in a wide variety of products. Regardless of whether it is toothpaste, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or pet food, they often contain hydrocolloids from algae with gelling or thickening properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more products arrive, other companies are working on textiles and plastic alternatives, including biodegradable packaging, water capsules and straws.<br />\r\nAlgae production is booming. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the volume doubled between 2005 and 2015 to more than 30 million tonnes per year. It is a company valued at more than $ 6 billion (&pound; 5 billion) worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, only a small proportion of the cultivation takes place outside Asia, where agriculture has long existed but is largely labor-intensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lots of effort&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;Labor costs in Europe are very high, so that&#39;s a big part of it,&quot; said Annette Brun, senior scientist at Aarhus University in Denmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A lot of effort has to be made to make it mechanic and scale.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make agriculture economical, he said: &quot;The yields must be increased and costs must be lowered.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the agricultural system is not easy to reproduce. &quot;Different areas in different bodies of water all require modification.

Norwegian research groups are working on new technologies to rationalize agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most of the algae is now used for food, but in the future we want to use it for fish feed, fertilizer and biogas.

It is designed in such a way that the robot can move on spokes like a wheel - either to tie threads with young algae or to collect them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We make a hand with a robot that goes back and forth. It has been tested in a dry laboratory,&quot; explained Ms. Forbord, but more investment is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AlgaPlus grows inland algae in a number of lakes and reservoirs in northern Portugal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s a much more controlled environment,&quot; said managing director Helena Abreu, who believes it has more of an advantage over offshore farming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We maintain the temperature and everything in the tank,&quot; he said. &quot;You have year-round production.&quot;<br />\r\nMs. Abreu co-founded the company after working as a marine biologist in the Azores for five years.

This is then pumped through the filter system into the algae tank. There is also a hatchery that plants seeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have to innovate from the ground up,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These waters are rich in nitrogen, which the algae absorbs and mimics nature. &ldquo;We don&#39;t need additives, we don&#39;t need fertilizer. We use fish water to grow our algae, &rdquo;he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Abreu does not believe that land availability is a limiting factor. Former salt flats and fish farms could be reallocated, he said, noting that there were hectares in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Algae cultivation is also practiced in Canada and South Africa. Microalgae are also grown in the tank system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are other challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The biggest obstacle is the energy cost. When you work with the tank, you have to pump it and aerate it to keep the water moving,&quot; said Ms. Abreu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies still can&#39;t stay on sales alone. However, Mrs. Abreu believes that the seaweed market will continue to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a big trend,&quot; he said. &quot;Every year there are more companies.

He first reported the problem to his local water supply about a year ago.

Some sensors have been in use over the years, but thanks in part to demands from industry authority Ofwat to reduce leaks by 16% over the next five years, the number of devices in use today has risen sharply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Utilities, one of the UK&#39;s largest water companies, currently deploys 102,000 sensors on its network in northwest England. The company has installed 46,000. A large number, but Hannah Wardle, a network utility manager, explained that it only covers 10% of the company&#39;s pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sensor uses an accelerometer, the same technology that detects the movement of your smartphone. In this case, however, the accelerometer will detect vibrations that may be associated with a leak anywhere along the pipe.<br />\r\nThere are other sensors, including an acoustic recorder, that can hear the characteristic hum of a working pipe. United Utilities teamed up with Fido Tech to improve an AI system that has been trained on these thousands of data sets. The system can now detect leaks with more than 90% accuracy and estimate them from low to high probability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most of the leaks were very likely to have been identified from behind,&quot; said Ms. Wardle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to exploit the true source of these leaks is the holy grail of pipeline maintenance. Ms. Wardle said the United Utilities system wasn&#39;t perfect, but with more data and testing, his team hopes to keep improving it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another technology that helps make installations smart is NB-IoT communications, a means of transmitting signals from thousands of remote sensors using only a fraction of the bandwidth. This means the tubular sensor can send updates to a central server more frequently without draining the battery, which is designed to last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, AI analyzes the increasing amount of data generated by these sensors to automatically detect any signs of leaks. The system should be released later this year, said Woodworth, who hopes SES can better identify leaks before customers report them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water scarcity is a growing problem in the UK, said Prof. Speith. Efforts to increase UK leakage with big data and AI are the &quot;next generation&quot; of solutions to old problems, he added. However, he noted that the age of the state network was getting under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In a lot of cases, it&#39;s not in very good shape and it&#39;s time to really think about large scale replacement,&quot; said Prof. Speight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nobody wants to deal with the cost, but in reality it has to be done at some point.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Mr. Woodworth is excited about his company&#39;s new sensors, he agrees that there must be a long-term solution to improving pipeline infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can no longer stick adhesive on our network,&quot; he said.</p>', 'Water Lost', '_113221211_leaks.worker.ses.water_1599251663.jpg', '2020-09-05 00:34:23', '2021-08-14 22:42:14'),

However, a larger inspection project at sea could involve a much larger ship with dozens of crew members and cost around &pound; 100,000 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensor equipment varies depending on the company. Sometimes it could be a sonar grid pulled behind a boat, another job could be an unmanned underwater vehicle that could be controlled by a surface surveyor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad weather can interfere with work and make life uncomfortable. &quot;I&#39;ve been at sea for nine years and done 10 holes and it&#39;s not a good place to work,&quot; said Brian Allen, CEO of Rovco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His company is one of the few looking to disrupt this market through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). They see a future where underwater robots called Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can carry out survey work without much human supervision and send the data back to surveyors in offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bristol-based Rovco is working on an important piece of technology. He trains AI systems to identify seabed objects based on data collected in the ocean. This process took four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The addition of AI means that the data does not have to be analyzed by someone on board or sent back ashore for evaluation. This work is actually done there and then by AI, which can operate on ships or, soon enough, the underwater robots themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Without AI, autonomous underwater robots are stupid enough - only to be able to trace pipelines and cables in pre-programmed paths,&quot; Allen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If the AUV can analyze real-time data, you can actually tell the robot to do something else. If you run into a problem, the survey can stop and more data can be collected while the robot makes its own decisions,&quot; he said. he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if the AI ​​signals something that looks like an unexploded bomb, the AI ​​can stop, come back, and perform additional analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some jobs, such as dismantling underwater oil and gas infrastructure, engineers need to know the exact dimensions and location of the equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support this, Rovco has also developed an image processing system that produces accurate maps of underwater infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system generates a 3D cloud from individual data points, a format used in modeling software such as CAD. These dots are combined with camera images to create a realistic 3D reconstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rovco currently combines vision systems, AI and underwater vehicles in one package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other companies are also trying to introduce AI into the industry.<br />\r\nJake Tompkins is the UK-based CEO of Modus, which has a fleet of 12 unmanned underwater vehicles. A two-year program will be launched with the University of Durham to develop an artificial intelligence control system that will allow some of their underwater vehicles to detect their location, objects and anomalies during the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination with Durham is a very effective way to develop technology, because they have proven AI systems for the automotive and aerospace industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using autonomous underwater robots to explore the ocean floor and inspect underwater structures will be &quot;a game for change,&quot; according to Tompkins, and should cut costs significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believes underwater robots will soon be out in the ocean, perhaps in an offshore wind farm or at an oil or gas facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If necessary, they are awakened and sent for data collection, which is sent back to the ground control center for processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we may still be two years or more from the first commercial use of autonomous ATVs, but that&#39;s where we are going,&quot; said Tompkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His company is currently working on ways to maintain AUV recharging outside of the oceans and technology that can send data back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are huge rewards for companies that can run and run smart underwater robots. According to Soren Lassen, director of offshore wind research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the offshore wind market is expected to grow &quot;enormously&quot; over the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only six countries currently have offshore wind energy on a commercial scale. In 10 years he predicts 20 countries will join the club.<br />\r\nLast year, 29 gigawatts of offshore wind power were connected to the worldwide grid. Wood Mackenzie estimates 180 gigawatts by 2029.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this, thousands of wind turbines had to be built and thousands of kilometers of cables had to be installed to connect these wind farms. All this requires underwater surveyor services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2029, most of the work at sea can be done in autonomous systems, with people returning to offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jess Hanham will continue to update her business with the latest technology, but worries that her job will be of less use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I love diversity. Because I stay in the office - I&#39;ll hate it. Going out and doing research, coming back and looking at it from start to finish - it gives you a sense of ownership of the job.

About 80% of tickets cost less than &pound; 50, and the highest-priced ticket, which has 4,000 seats in the final, costs &pound; 121.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tournament organizers awarded 20,021 tickets to key staff during the tournament to thank them for their contribution during the Covid-19 pandemic</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lingering spirit of Covid-19 overshadowed the event itself, and Dutton admitted, &quot;We looked at various scenarios including social distancing from game fans, indoor games, and what would happen if the event was postponed or not resumed at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every option is on the table, but we have tried to focus on what we can control. We try to be agile in our response because we are responsible for the public funds we have to protect.&quot; . &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fans will receive a full refund if any of the above situations occurs and the ticket cannot be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social Impact and Mental Health Heritage<br />\r\nThe 2021 World Cup is the 16th edition of the tournament which was first held in 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Said Dutton, &quot;Of course we want to fill the stadium and make it commercially successful. But we also want to implement our legacy program - social impact in terms of supporting the government&#39;s compensation program for the north of England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2015 we spoke with the government at the time about how we could focus more on cities and municipalities in what used to be Nordkraftwerk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nordic power plant was a proposal to stimulate economic growth in northern England and has since been replaced by promises from the Boris Johnson administration to calm down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcome of discussions at Whitehall in 2015 was that the central government had allocated &pound; 25 million to fund the 16 nation tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately 80% of events take place in the north of England and are centered on the M62 corridor linking Liverpool and Hull via Manchester and Leeds. There will also be games in Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Coventry and London.<br />\r\n&quot;We wanted to make a difference,&quot; said Dutton, who was watching his Premier League games at the age of five. &quot;Our volunteer program will be very comprehensive and will represent the local communities where the games are held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There will be culture, heritage, public health, education and participation initiatives. There will also be a mental health legacy as we work with Movember to develop resistance training for young adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s also important to leave a physical legacy in the form of a facility. We can help turn the facility into a smaller rugby club through cash grants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New countries and audiences<br />\r\nIt was also the first time in World Cup history that competitions for men, women and wheelchairs were held at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under a contract with the BBC, all 61 matches will be broadcast live, compared to just seven of the 28 when the last event was held in England in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 21 seats of all shapes and sizes, including many high-level football stadiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlights include the opening match at Newcastle, a two-headed ball at Liverpool&#39;s home stadium, Anfield, Arsenal&#39;s first non-football event at the Emirates Stadium and the men&#39;s and women&#39;s doubles final at Old Trafford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tournament&#39;s new names include Greece, Jamaica and Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We hope to reach a new global television audience so everyone can consume RLWC,&quot; said Dutton.<br />\r\nThe men&#39;s competition consists of 16 teams taking part in four groups of four teams each. Women&#39;s events have grown from six to eight teams, and wheelchair events have grown from seven to eight teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We make sure that every team is treated equally when it comes to money,&quot; said Dutton. &quot;For the first time ever, there are also cash prizes at women&#39;s and wheelchair competitions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued: &quot;It is important that the World Cup plays a role in the development of the rugby league.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We want to make sure that this tournament can last a long time. We want to use the tournament to arouse and arouse people&#39;s interest in the sport.&quot;</p>', 'Rugby League, World Cup', '_113873727_gettyimages-884258116_1599254427.jpg', '2020-09-05 01:20:27', '2021-08-14 22:41:17'),

Steroids relieve inflammation and the immune system, which is why they have been used in conditions such as arthritis and asthma, as well as some serious infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medication is not considered useful in the early stages of a Coronavirus infection - if symptoms include coughing, fever, or a sudden loss of taste or smell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as the disease progresses, the immune system can become overwhelmed and damage the lungs and other organs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Covid stage is believed to help steroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you take a bottle of oxygen for a patient with Covid, you may need to take a prescription for a corticosteroid,&quot; said Professor Martin Landray of the University of Oxford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These results are immediately usable. These results are widely available, inexpensive, and are a well-understood drug that reduces mortality.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors are already using dexamethasone according to results earlier this year, but there is hope that different drug options will improve access to treatment worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicines can be swallowed in tablet form or given intravenously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, research has focused on low-dose steroids. There is no evidence that a higher dose is more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Health Organization is expected to publish new guidelines for doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, NHS Executive Director Sir Simon Stevens said, &quot;Like dexamethasone, the NHS will now take urgent action to ensure that patients who may benefit from hydrocortisone treatment do so by adding one more.&quot; Weapons in the world&#39;s arsenal against Covid-19 &quot;.</p>', 'Cheap Steriods, Coronavirus', 'Cheap Steriod_1599309903.jpg', '2020-09-05 16:45:03', '2021-08-14 22:37:46'),

It was clear from the start that one day he would become a superstar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haverz has the technical capabilities of the number 10, but cannot be classified as such. Its size (6 feet 2 inches) and dynamic style make it a choice for a variety of roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has often played in Leverkusen&#39;s midfield, but also in midfield, from the right flank and, more recently, as a striker. National coach Joachim Lowe also likes to test him in a deeper role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some in Germany saw him as the new Michael Ballack. The former Bayern Munich and Chelsea midfielder shares similar traits: he not only pulls the strings with passes, but also makes powerful breakthroughs on the pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Haverz Balak&#39;s incredible physique is lacking, he is perhaps the shrewd runner who suddenly appears behind the back line to score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havertz is a modern playmaker who combines transition skills, foresight, calm under pressure and a high level of sportsmanship. He didn&#39;t try any terrible tricks or do anything ineffective. He is a useless player in the form of his new manager Frank Lampard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haverz lacks a colorful personality and, like many German players of his generation, lets his feet do the talking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was Havertz&#39;s previous story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He grew up as the son of a police officer and lawyer in the small village of Mariadorf and became a fan and youth player of local club Alemannia Aachen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was 10 years old, he caught the attention of talent scout Bayer Leverkusen, who persuaded him to switch to the Bundesliga power plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since young Havertz still lived in Aachen, he had to drive from school to Leverkusen youth academy several times a week. After joining the U17s, he moved to the home of stadium announcer Klaus Schenkmann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no history of wealth in tatters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kai is lucky enough to come from a low-income family. Both his mother and father are humble,&quot; said J&uuml;rgen Gelsdorf, former director of the Leverkusen Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havertz graduated from high school when he was a permanent member of the Leverkusen senior team. He once said, &quot;I can&#39;t go to school in the morning because we are practicing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the afternoon he had to catch up on subject matter. &quot;At some point I couldn&#39;t do it anymore. My energy was gone. I wanted to give up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Roger Schmid&#39;s manager persuaded him to stay on track, and it worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his classmates traveled to Lake Garda in Italy, Haverz made his Champions League debut against Tottenham at Wembley in front of an audience of 85,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did he fit in with Chelsea?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havertz can be used in a variety of different positions and systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his most likely role is as first choice number 10 in 4-2-3-1 or number eight continued in 4-3-3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Blues already have a wing group and with the signing of Timo Werner two very talented forwards. You don&#39;t need to experiment with Havertz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He moves between the lines with ease and can offer a unique presence in Chelsea&#39;s midfield.

Nipple 98 while Mark Wood and Joffra Archer bent too short - the batsmen repeatedly hit four balls on the back foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when Finch knocks the old Archer down to 46, Smith looks comfortable. He drew his first ball - a 94 mph delivery from Wood - for four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happened next was extraordinary. Smith fired Rashid when he was 18, and Maxwell hit the final ball of the Spinner spell for extra protection - a mistake that turned out to be very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner sailed 56 balls later - taking its bearings from Archer - and then taken out of a fast delivery by Wood via Alex Kerry</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wikis fall and dry up. After Smiths Schmidt on the 14th, there were no restrictions, while Stoinis&#39; big shot went over the extra cover with another five balls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stoinis has tried to play on his own and helped himself get the necessary trail from the final. He cleared the laces once, but also missed two more deliveries and tried to pass the ball. Curran keeps up her nerve when the Australian station wagon isn&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Australia&#39;s first competitive match in nearly six months due to the coronavirus pandemic, an mitigating factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malan again proved his ability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&#39;s total appears to be less than half, it doesn&#39;t matter when Warner and Finch appear to be competing for victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Butler has given England a quick start, with seven limits on 29-ball shots, including two six-per-second from spinner Ashton Agar which lasts 16 rounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England were 64-1 when butler Adam Zampas slammed a nut into the deep center goal and then made the breakdown himself. Eoin Morgan&#39;s team lost 5-60 when Australia&#39;s excellent bowling, mostly spinning balls and slower, proved effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is up to Malan, who is in third place, to collect the test results for the hosts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the straps fell around him, he calmed down. He fought relatively calmly until he launched his attack on Zampa on the 18th. He hit two six-points - one in the middle of goal and one in a long period - which cost 22 and increased England&#39;s failed innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Malan&#39;s eighth result out of 50 or more in the 14 T20 international.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England still have players to come back - Jason Roy and Ben Stokes were not in the game but Malan, who won his second T20 against Pakistan, quickly became unstoppable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our bowling saved us&quot; - that&#39;s what they said</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England captain Eoin Morgan: &quot;We didn&#39;t fight well tonight - David and Joss.

She recommends checking out the men&#39;s clothing section of the charity shop. &quot;Little men&#39;s shirts can look very nice or oversized.&quot; And he suggests choosing fabrics like silk and cotton over synthetic fibers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He admits that the illusory classic, the perfect white shirt, is hard to find secondhand because it&#39;s often a little tinted. But while she&#39;s had some super whitening accidents, she says that a small bottle of bleach or vanishing for white is &quot;brilliant if you soak it&quot;. The manufacturer offers to soak for half an hour, but Watkins recommends an overnight soak: &quot;You&#39;ll be amazed what comes out.&quot; He also recommends using white vinegar on the armpits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&#39;re looking for something tidy for the office or a flock of seagulls that are too large, there&#39;s a used blazer for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Take the time to find out what you are looking for,&quot; said Moizant. If you search online, &quot;Make sure you have narrowed your search and done some research. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask the salesperson additional questions or details about a particular measurement.&quot; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the blazer doesn&#39;t fit well despite the sizing, don&#39;t be afraid to play with it, says Watkins, who often removes layers and shoulder pads to soften the shape and bring it closer to you. body. If you or a friend aren&#39;t sewing, it&#39;s a good idea to familiarize yourself with a local dry cleaning service. &quot;Most will work with a fairly experienced tailor who can get you a 12-15 pound blazer. You can try and it will suit you,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garnett recommends a little blazer: &quot;If it looks a little manic, try it, because sometimes light jackets look really stylish - a little rough at the edges or look too big.&quot; see how it feels. Sometimes you will be surprised. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jumper</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ebay is full of old cashmere sweaters which are worth a look. Garnett also recommends going to a charity shop and looking for an old V-neck in the men&#39;s section. Moizant is a big fan of the big, &quot;never out of date&quot; turtleneck. He advises, &quot;Pick iconic brands and classic silhouettes that you know are timeless and can be used for any occasion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is one word on everyone&#39;s lips: moth. &quot;I found a lot of good knitwear, but it broke,&quot; says Watkins. Unfortunately the moth will get all the tissue it deserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When shopping for produce, keep the sweater in a bright place, place your hands under the sleeves, and straighten it properly for moth damage. &quot;You don&#39;t want to bring something that might contain moth eggs into your home,&quot; says Watkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you take something home and it has more holes than you think, Watkins recommends an invisible fix: &quot;If it&#39;s not completely destroyed, I&#39;ll take it.&quot; If you don&#39;t have these skills, they are easy to learn. And here, says Watkins, dry cleaning can be a valuable resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course there are always modern used items. &quot;You can definitely find modern used cashmere,&quot; says Watkins. She recommends eBay and says that as long as people are honest about the state of the sale, you should be fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grattidge and Burgess-Hunt recommend that you have cloth bags in your closet: &quot;They protect your clothes from moths ... and keep items from losing their shape by hanging.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to make a used wardrobe capsule Sweatpants - I have attached a photo of Alexander Wang&#39;s knitwear and a painted vintage tie. Right now Ikat Dye is being sold as a main dye for me! Very easy to carry!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart pants will be in a lot of people&#39;s wardrobes. &quot;When I look for black pants, I look for brands like Comme des Garcons, Yohji, Yves Saint Laurent ... their shapes have stood the test of time,&quot; says Watkins. &quot;From a current perspective, I&#39;ve always thought brands like Joseph were good - brands like this are pretty easy to get.&quot; Look for good fabrics like wool and know their measurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Watkins, if a vendor doesn&#39;t provide online measurements, don&#39;t be afraid to ask - he doesn&#39;t put them as defaults on his site, but he&#39;s always happy to send them to someone if he wants. &quot;It only takes one second,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with jeans, if you&#39;ve found pants that match, study their sizes and look for other pants with similar shapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sports clothing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although not always considered a staple food, sports subordinates are already on the list of many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I like a good track,&quot; said Watkins. She&#39;s still looking for a replacement for the hippest pair she&#39;s ever had - a pair of sweaty Betty&#39;s pure merino wool that &quot;can&#39;t make their knees wide&quot; picked up at a charity shop. Brands like Joseph, Akne, and Ganni, expensive second-hand items, are worth looking for secondhand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old-fashioned tracksuits were very different from what people are looking for today in this era of prestigious clothing, says Watkins. Still, he&#39;s a fan of Fruit of the Loom, whose items appear regularly on eBay or Depop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________-</p>', 'wardRobe, Capsules', 'Fashion is abiut how adapt_1599348929.jpg', '2020-09-06 03:35:29', '2021-08-13 06:18:49'),

Take the word &quot;deadstock&quot;. Formal, an industrial term that is often interpreted as saying that manufacturers do not use substances, have recently become part of our common language. Brands using raw milk in their projects are becoming increasingly popular with consumers who appreciate the idea of ​​saving waste from landfill. The fact that we even address this in fashion articles shows that sustainability is a priority in a post-pandemic world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, as with most keywords, there is much more to it than meets the eye. In some fashion corners, this term is more likely to refer to unused and unused items rediscovered by handsome vintage dealers, as well as a number of contacts with old warehouses. Deadstock Nike Jordans, for example, would be a holy grail theme for the confident hip animal. This idea is also called into question in terms of its environmental benefits. Some argue that while using inanimate products is definitely better than making from scratch, brands can actually use what is known as &quot;available inventory&quot; - additional fabric manufacturers produce together with orders in the belief that it will be sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Without clear terminology, brands can name dead products, dead stocks for them because nobody buys them, not marketable items,&quot; said Dillis Williams, director of the Center for Sustainable Fashion at London College. fashion. &quot;This is a controversial area. The terminology can correct abused concepts and reinforce others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe we should return to a related term - &quot;upcycling&quot;. Often used to describe crafty projects at home that could, for example, turn an old water bottle into a toothbrush holder. Designers make it a touch of fashion by directing vintage clothes and fabrics. Virgil Abloh&#39;s latest collection for Louis Vuitton uses fabric from the brand&#39;s archives. Up to half of the Marine Serre collection is created this way. Collina Strada&#39;s latest collaboration with Browns uses clothing from the secondary market in Accra. This is a straightforward commentary on how the West shipped second-hand clothing to Africa before - because of their enormous volume - many of them ending up in landfills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just high-end designers. A smaller group of labels is using this technique to turn old clothes into new ones. The Berlin-based Fade Out label, founded by Andrea Bonfini and Nicola Gomiero, uses 70% vintage clothing to create new clothes. Dresses and tops cost around 200 euros. Bonfini said this was done partly for environmental reasons, but also for aesthetic reasons. &quot;The vintage denim and the fabrics we recycle influence the uniqueness of each and every piece. We deconstruct and assemble all the clothes as a game of mosaic tiles every time they are different and unique.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goodbye Francis&#39; Carly Sheck uses vintage blankets made everywhere from home permits to eBay to create his own work, including the $ 25 (&pound; 19) face mask featured on vogue.com. &quot;I want to show people that beautiful things can be made from textiles that are already there,&quot; he said. &quot;I firmly believe that some of these old textiles are made with more love and care, so they tend to last longer than newer materials made today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Bonfini and Scheck enjoyed the original design. &quot;Usually you sketch out your idea and then you get the material,&quot; says Shek. &quot;However, with vintage or secondhand materials, usually the fabric is found and then the design is directed. I think this involves a lot more problem solving and a different part of the brain than most designers are used to.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Bonfini, life can provide inspiration and material. &ldquo;The vintage bag collection was born after I made my own clothes. His bag was found at home after I moved, &quot;he said. &quot;For a cut made with an old football team scarf, we have to thank a friend who sells vintage clothing in Berlin and stumbled across a supply of scarves.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Williams says these designers weren&#39;t the first to discover the fun of climbing. She checks the names Bethany Williams and Christopher Rayburn, but also cites Stella McCartney&#39;s first collection from 1996 using vintage lace and silk, and depicts JJ Knoki, a designer who became famous with items at the same time. Made from vintage t-shirts and denim cuts, like &quot;The Don Works That Way&quot;. She wanted to emphasize that &quot;we need multiple approaches&quot; to really increase the environmental impact of fashion, &quot;but the opportunities to reuse, renew and recycle clothing in the UK are enormous&quot;.

They argued that Harris was a &quot;woman in action.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris&#39;s love for bohemian shoes was first noticed last year when he was a Democratic presidential candidate and appeared on Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars.

We usually pack our summer closets here and visit the shops to freshen up in the fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the changes in 2020 have occurred in a big way.

June without Glastonbury, July without school year end, August without the usual beach rituals. Our summer dressing room is actually not that tired.

The sleek black silk facepiece I wear to please loved ones who reject my claim of comfort over &quot;just a mother to be a fantasy,&quot; she says, is the best skin for us. Engelman (Consultant Dermatology at Elizabeth Arden) coined the term &quot;mask&quot; after seeing an increase in private patients - especially those wearing PPE at work - with acne, friction sores, clogged pores, and irritation during the crisis. 19</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her first recommendation (before using beta hydroxy acid at night: I swear by Paula&#39;s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (10 to 30 million pounds) sweep up after cleansing) to switch to silk facials whenever possible. It causes the least amount of friction in any tissue, prevents minor skin wounds on the cheeks and nose from healing, clogs pores and blemishes in the process (Engelman calls it the &quot;acne mechanism&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silk is also cool and breathable, which is an important aid in the chin area. My dermatologist approved mask mentioned above comes from Slip (&pound; 39), my favorite hair tie maker.

At the time, they hoped seat belts would become mandatory because they cost a lot less than air bags, which other tech lobbyists championed. &quot;[If seat belts become mandatory], airbag enthusiasts, which swell on impact to protect the driver, fear the device will never be widely used,&quot; wrote the New York Times on February 28, 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up to 65% of Americans oppose seat belts for convenience reasons<br />\r\nOne air bag cost up to $ 800 in the mid-1980s compared to a few dollars for seat belts. If the law required all cars to wear air bags, the price of the new car would go up, which would shock the market a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers are most interested in comfort. One study found that 86% of Americans admit seat belts save lives, while only 41% of those people actually use them (other research shows the numbers are even lower in other countries). Meanwhile, 65% of Americans oppose seat belts for convenience reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance companies prefer airbags to seat belts. The advantage of air bags is that they are &quot;passive&quot; - ​​ready to save your life. When airbags are installed, drivers have no choice but to use them or not, thereby reducing injury and death from accidents and, consequently, company payments. Police are against stopping drivers to enforce the law. Passive airbags mean employees can avoid stopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seat belt unit faces the pro airbag unit. But debates usually don&#39;t focus on what saves more lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York was the first US state to enact legislation on January 1, 1985, a few years after Britain, Canada, France and Germany made seat belts mandatory in the front seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it took years for seat belt laws to be fully implemented. In some countries, differences between their first acquaintance with the driver in the front seat and the passenger in the rear seat have existed for decades. For example, Japan first made seat belts mandatory in the driver&#39;s seat in 1971, but became a legal requirement for rear seat passengers in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laws have also been introduced in some states and before others. This means you can travel US lines in the US, wear your seat belt when out, but take it off when you travel. And New Hampshire doesn&#39;t have a law that requires adults to wear seat belts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three countries in the United States that do not require helmets for motorcyclists of all ages<br />\r\nThe same confusing approach applies to other public health measures, such as the adoption of the motorcycle helmet law. There are three states in the United States (Illinois, Iowa, and New Hampshire) that do not require helmets for motorcyclists of all ages, but border states where all riders are required to wear them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural context</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Illinois, another state that introduced new seat belt laws in 1985, wearing seat belts was seen as a minor offense from the initial introduction with a fine of up to $ 25 (nearly &pound; 50 when adjusted for inflation). A reasonable fine should convince motorists that the law should not be strictly enforced. Instead, police officers have announced publicly that they will only impose fines if there is another crime worthy of stopping the driver. The law goes even further, stating that violating the Seat Belt Act cannot constitute negligence, meaning insurance companies still have to pay if a driver is injured without wearing it. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, four motorists accused under the new law have tried to challenge his constitutionality in court. There&#39;s a positive side: when Illinois passed a law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets in 1969, the Illinois Supreme Court imposed unconstitutional restrictions on personal freedom, a decision that continues to this day. However, on that occasion, the court sentenced the suing motorist.</p>', 'Laws that save lives, airbags law', 'Why people object to laws that save lives_1599595452.', '2020-09-09 00:04:12', '2021-07-02 01:46:42'),

But that&#39;s rarely as important as it was in the last six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the arsenal against the coronavirus - masks, self-isolation and social distancing - one thing is very easily overlooked: washing hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the coronavirus became a global health emergency in February, health officials have been trying to tell people how to protect themselves from the new virus. One piece of advice that is repeated daily in newsletters, advertisements, and expert interviews is to wash your hands with warm water with soap for at least 20 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Health Organization publishes a widely remembered table showing the correct way to wash your hands: instructions familiar to anyone who has worked in a bar or restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months later, a confusing global picture of hopping and local blockages - such as the recent night in Melbourne, Australia - suggests washing your hands at the border. Against the backdrop of the growing reaction in some neighborhoods to the use of masks and face coatings, this other silver bullet against coronavirus infection has been removed from the spotlight. An unverified Ethiopian observational study found that less than 1% of the more than 1,000 people who visited the hospital had washed their hands properly. But has the board changed? (Read Why Some People Don&#39;t Wash Their Hands.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also like ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason some people don&#39;t wash their hands<br />\r\nWhy do we all have to wear masks<br />\r\nWhy should personal contacts change<br />\r\nNot at all, say experts. If nothing else, they have doubled their effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas Gilbert, professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, said the coronavirus&#39;s chemical makeup could not be compromised by anything more specialized than cheap soap and warm water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These viruses have a membrane that surrounds genetic particles called a lipid membrane because they have a fatty and fatty structure,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s more of a structure than neutralized by soap and water.&quot; This outer &quot;shell&quot; disintegration destroys the viral cell and the genetic material RNA, which hijacks human cells to make copies of the virus, is stored and destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of anything that reduces hand washing time,&quot; says Gilbert. &quot;What you want to do is wet your hands, get some soap and apply a suitable lather, then scrub your hands for 20 seconds and do it at every corner.&quot; That gives enough time, Gilbert said. carry out chemical reactions between membrane lipids and soap. &quot;There is another benefit - it also allows the soap to properly dispose of the ingredients.&quot; And with warm water, Gilbert added, the entire fight against the virus is &quot;happening a little faster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Michaelis, a professor of molecular science at the University of Kent in the UK, says water alone is not enough to kill the virus. &quot;If you have olive oil on your finger when you boil it, it is very difficult to remove it with just water,&quot; he said. &quot;You need soap.&quot; As for the corona virus, soap is needed in the same way &quot;to remove this lipid shell so that all viruses are deactivated&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effectiveness of hand washing is somewhat skewed due to the widespread use of hand sanitizers or small bottles that people carry outside of homes or stations that people should use when entering supermarkets and bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve been at home all day and 20 strangers aren&#39;t running around your house, washing your hands isn&#39;t necessary for just that reason - Thomas Gilbert<br />\r\n&quot;It&#39;s not a bad idea to have something like this in your car or at your front door,&quot; says Gilbert. &quot;These things are great if you don&#39;t have access to a sink, soap, and water. I always prefer soap and water to hand sanitizer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how often should we wash our hands?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of the pandemic, the UK government&#39;s Scientific Council was supposed to wash their hands every few hours - despite the fact that the majority of the population was locked in their homes. Gilbert says this doesn&#39;t really matter to those who stay at home most of the day - although of course they should wash their hands normally after going to the toilet, before prep, and before eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those caring for someone with Covid-19 - and many other viruses for that matter - are likely to want to wash their hands more often, especially if they come in contact with objects or surfaces that an infected patient has touched. or cough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you are at home all day and 20 strangers are not running around your house, that&#39;s why washing your hands is unnecessary,&quot; he said. Another article cited by doctoral student Thi Mui Pham from Utrecht University found that washing hands immediately after coming into contact with a potentially infected person or surface is much more effective than washing regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people have turned to antiviral hand washing and believe that it is more effective than regular soap - and it isn&#39;t, says Michaelis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You really don&#39;t need things like that,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the antimicrobials on the market are actually antibacterial.&quot; Overuse could cause problems in the future, he warned. &quot;If you have too many antibacterial agents (which don&#39;t work on viruses) in your wastewater, you have a greater chance of fighting bacteria,&quot; he said. &quot;Any other disinfectant you can use [except soap] ... can create more environmental problems and create more problems with resistant bacteria along the way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Gilbert and Michaelis agree that water doesn&#39;t have to be drinkable to be a weapon against the coronavirus.<br />\r\nOf course, washing your hands is much easier when you have a reliable supply of water. In less developed parts of the world, water is a less secure resource - and in many of these places public health standards and living conditions are often sub-optimal. In fact, until this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that only two out of five schools in the world had adequate hand washing facilities before the corona virus pandemic broke out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Gilbert and Michaelis agree that water doesn&#39;t have to be of drinking quality to be a weapon against the coronavirus. &quot;As long as you have soap or something, that&#39;s okay.

In other words, these simple math errors can cost lives - meaning correcting deviations should be a priority as we try to smooth the curve and avoid a second wave of pandemics worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also like ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Problems in math that could stop the world<br />\r\nThe 3.5% rule: How a small minority can change the world<br />\r\nPeople with hidden immunity to Covid-19<br />\r\nIn order to understand the origin of this particular tendency, we must first look at different types of growth. The best known is &quot;linear&quot;. If your garden is producing three apples a day, you have six in two days, nine in three days, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, exponential growth accelerates over time. Perhaps the simplest example is population growth. The more people you reproduce, the faster the population will grow. Or if you have weeds in your pond that triples every day, the number of plants may be small - only three per day two and nine per day three</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our tendency to ignore exponential growth has been known for thousands of years. According to Indian legend, the brahman Sisa ibn Dahir was offered a reward for creating an early version of the Shah. He asked for a grain of wheat to be placed in the first room of the board, two for the second room, four for the third room, and to be duplicated each time in the 64th room. Apparently, the king laughed off the humility of Ibn Dahir&#39;s request - until his treasure hunters announced that they would surpass any food in the country (a total of 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grain).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&#39;t until the late 2000s that scientists began to officially investigate this bias. Research shows that most people - like Remnant King ibn Dahir - intuitively assume that most growth is linear, which leads them to grossly underestimate exponential growth rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This early study looked primarily at the impact on our bank balances. For example, most savings accounts offer compound interest, which gives you additional interest on the interest already earned. This is a classic example of exponential growth and means that even low interest rates will pay off over time. If you had 5% interest, &pound; 1,000 invested today would cost &pound; 1,050 next year and &pound; 1,220.50 next year ... which is more than &pound; 7,000 in 40 years. However, most people don&#39;t know how much money they will make by investing early, so they leave little time for retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption If the number of pearls on the chessboard is doubled for each square, 64 &quot;holds&quot; 18 trillion<br />\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption If the number of pearls on the chessboard is doubled for each square, 64 &quot;holds&quot; 18 trillion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to reducing their savings, this bias also makes people more vulnerable to negative credit, which is debt that increases over time. According to a 2008 study, bias increases the debt-to-income ratio from an average of 23% to an average of 54%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprisingly, higher levels of education do not prevent people from making this mistake. Even mathematics-trained natural science students can face risks, says Daniela Sele, who studies economic decision-making at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. &quot;This helps a little, but doesn&#39;t get rid of bias,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be due to the fact that they rely on intuition rather than advisory thinking. Even if they learn about complex interests, they forget to apply them. Worse, most people will confidently report that they understand exponential growth, but then still succumb to the tendency when asked to rate something as compound interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I explore in my book The Intelligence Trap, intelligent, educated people often have blind spots and believe they are less prone to error than other people - and the exponential growth bias seems to be dead at the center of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people will report confidently on an understanding of exponential growth, but then stick to a bias<br />\r\nOnly this year - at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic - did researchers begin to consider whether bias could influence our understanding of infectious diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to various epidemiological studies, the number of new Covid-19 cases is doubling every three to four days without intervention, which is why so many scientists recommend a rapid blockade to prevent the pandemic from getting out of control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, Joris Lamers of the University of Bremen in Germany started an online study together with Jan Cruzius and Ann Gast of the University of Cologne, where people were asked about the possible spread of the disease. Their results suggest that the trend toward exponential growth dominates understanding of the spread of the virus, with most people significantly underestimating growth rates. More importantly, the team found that these beliefs were directly linked to participants&#39; views on how best to limit spread.

However, Gooden says it gives indications of reduplication, an element basic in creole and pidgin dialects wherein existing words in a language are utilized to make new words. In Jamaican Creole, for instance, &quot;laaf&quot; signifies essentially &quot;chuckle,&quot; however &quot;laaf-laaf&quot; becomes &quot;to snicker a great deal.&quot; In Turkish, not regularly gathered with contact dialects, &quot;derin&quot; signifies &quot;profound,&quot; while &quot;derin&quot; signifies &quot;profoundly.&quot; Traces like this offer indications about the sources of dialects when other authentic pieces of information might be absent, Gooden says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an explanation contact dialects have generally deserved less admiration, says Nala H Lee, an etymologist at the National University of Singapore who composed a diagram of the status of contact dialects in the 2020 Annual Review of Linguistics. &quot;They&#39;ve been believed to be adulterated renditions of segment dialects from which they have been determined,&quot; she says. &quot;Individuals consider them being less acceptable or not genuine dialects.&quot; Sometimes contemptuously alluded to as &quot;kitchen dialects,&quot; they are spoken in casual settings and are probably not going to be recorded or utilized in legitimate issues, for example, in court reports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tongues are important for a people&#39;s social or ethnic character and history&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, they are well worth sparing, Lee says. The tongues are important for a people&#39;s social or ethnic personality and history: when they vanish, which they do at a lopsided rate to develop dialects, a whole convention can pass on with them. The Gullah Geechee language, for instance, has a special culture that comes, alongside the tongue, from relatives of the slave exchange despite everything living on the southern Atlantic Coast of the United States. Contact dialects likewise are a trove for etymologists concentrating how dialects advance and how our minds figure out how to talk them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In research distributed in 2018 in the diary Language Documentation and Conservation, Lee reviewed 96 contact dialects for peril. She scored them by the quantity of familiar speakers, the degree to which they are being passed to the people to come and how generally they&#39;re utilized by the individuals who despite everything talk them.

In 1981 and 1982, the naval force filled the reactor with black-top and abandoned it east of Novaya Zemlya island in a simple 108ft (33m) of water.

However, as base camp battled with the choice to dispatch a costly salvage helicopter, the team continued attempting to keep the submarine above water.

Additionally, this number consistently decreases as a lady ages: from 1,000,000 eggs during childbirth to 300,000 by pubescence, 25,000 by the age of 37 and 1,000 by the age of 51. Of all these, notwithstanding, only 300 to 400 eggs with infant making-potential &ndash; typically only one per month &ndash; will develop and in the long run be delivered from a lady&#39;s ovaries through ovulation over her whole life. For reasons not yet completely comprehended, the rest go through a characteristic cycle of degeneration and will never be ovulated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While egg considers decrease ladies age, so does the nature of the chromosomes and the DNA contained inside each egg&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most young ladies start discharging somewhere in the range of nine and 13 years old, yet their ovaries don&#39;t begin delivering eggs until a least a year or two later. Basic science would propose a lady&#39;s egg gracefully would then ordinarily debilitate itself around 33 years after the fact. Also, in most ladies, fruitfulness does without a doubt will in general stop as long as eight years before the beginning of menopause, which for American ladies is around the hour of their 51st birthday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While such unrefined counts don&#39;t consider the normal inconstancy that can exist between ladies, or the time windows during which ovaries may deliver more than one egg in a month, or months in which no egg is delivered by any means, they can give an unpleasant gauge of exactly how long the female ripeness course of events can be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more exact gauge of a lady&#39;s egg check, otherwise called &quot;ovarian save&quot;, can be gotten by estimating the degree of hormone called hostile to Mullerian hormone (AMH) in a lady&#39;s blood. We currently realize that AMH, delivered by the ovaries of ripe, grown-up ladies, assumes a fundamental part in the transformation of a juvenile egg cell into a develop, confident egg, total with the all the natural essentials to make a sound infant. Better working ovaries, with bigger egg stores, produce more AMH. Levels of the hormone decay as the course of events of female richness advances &ndash; normal levels in 30 to long term olds are about 66% that of more youthful ladies while levels in ladies matured more than 45 years are a fourth of those found in ladies in their 20s.</p>', 'female fertility, can female fertility be extended', 'How far can female fertility be extended_1599598330.', '2020-09-09 00:52:11', '2021-08-16 13:56:02'),

All things considered, for what reason would you need to spread air around the room in the winter? Sounds drafty. Indeed numerous roof fans have a converse setting, explicitly focused on use when temperatures are low. Warmth ascents obviously, which implies that the pleasant warm air over your radiators heads on up towards the roof, instead of where you&#39;d most like it &ndash; at sitting stature in case you&#39;re in your family room.

Warm separation happens, with hotter air close to the roof and cooler air let down where the individuals sit. So the thought is that if a fan is run on a low setting backward, destratification will happen.

Rodrigue is one of the few people who still manage to attend the center as a coach. Despite feeling relieved that no one was in the building, Rodrigue was devastated to see that it had been demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do everything for free. I train people for free. I fix things for free. Everything is free because I love it and this is my life,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s why I cried when the explosion happened. It was so loud.&quot; The Lebanese Rowing Association was founded in 1968. Despite being underfunded and run almost entirely by volunteers, it is home to about 20 active rowers, from children to veterans from Beirut waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the city itself, this society was home to rowers of all origins. Rodrigue is a Christian and his dual partner Akram is a Shia Muslim. Many of the Sunni, Shia and Christian rowers at the club have close ties outside the club, such as attending weddings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are like family,&quot; said Rodrigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/CF0B/production/_114230035_mediaitem114230034.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>General Hassan Rustom, President of the Confederation since 1998, recalls when the explosion occurred. &quot;I was sitting at home with my family and suddenly my house was shaken by an earthquake. I can&#39;t even describe the sounds and feelings that are left for us,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find the dog that was lost in Beirut explosion &quot;We rushed to read the news and learned of the explosion in Beirut port. I went straight to our training center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will never forget what I saw that day on the way to the training center. It was a nightmare. Thank God no one was training at that time because of the Covid-19 restrictions. The rowing center was completely destroyed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3E6E/production/_114228951_mediaitem114228950.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rowing club has been an important part of Fara Jarudi&#39;s life since he was ten years old. She collected four gold medals at the Lebanese National Championships between 2003 and 2013, but now she only counts when she has free time from her job as an interior designer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of Fara&#39;s most beautiful days have been spent rowing the 2 km up and down the harbor. It compares the movement back and forth with meditation. &quot;I feel like I&#39;m with water. It&#39;s very comforting,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/B8BC/production/_114229274_mediaitem114229273.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a break in training, he and his rowmate Hiba relax on the boat and catch up. Sometimes they play music and sing to the legendary Lebanese singer Fairuz as the sun sets over the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And because they are in open water, the rowers in Beirut encounter more wildlife than most. &quot;Sometimes the dolphins come in. If they lose track, they go to the port. We have turtles that are very old - sometimes they come to the surface and we are very happy, &rdquo;said Farah with a laugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As soon as we reach 2 km at the end, you are near open water. There are a lot of seagulls there - that&#39;s a good sight.&quot; Sometimes the water can be dangerous and the rowers have to keep an eye on the ships entering the harbor. On August 4, Farah was on vacation in Istanbul when she was bombarded with WhatsApp messages asking if she was okay. Then he saw the material from the explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We kept saying, &#39;Looks like Hiroshima, looks like Hiroshima.&#39; I continued watching the video. I was shaking, like I was in a movie, &quot;he said. &quot;Before Beirut was full of color, now it&#39;s black and white. It looks the same as it was during the civil war,&quot; he said. Even though the club was destroyed, there was hope for recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rowers from all over the world have expressed a desire to help with boats and other equipment while others have offered donations. There are also plans to create a crowdfunding page. Rodrigue, who won a silver medal at the Arab Indoor Rowing Championships in 2018, dreams of hosting the 2024 Olympics in Paris. He acknowledged that prior to the explosion was a difficult task due to a lack of funds and facilities in Lebanon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I imagined my coach, who I didn&#39;t have. I imagined him standing in front of me. When my sword fell, I imagined the coach yelling at me, &#39;Watch out!&#39; He said. Rodrigue is determined to get the club up and running as quickly as possible - even if there is a lack of hope in Beirut. Lebanon was besieged by an economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic even before the outbreak broke out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After all this happened, I can&#39;t hope anymore. When I hope something happens and it goes away, it&#39;s hard to overcome, it&#39;s very difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;I go through each day, but I care about my future and I don&#39;t want to give up my dreams.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even though his club was destroyed along with most of his city, Rodrigue still counts the blessings. &quot;I can&#39;t wish for anything else,&quot; he said. &quot;Looking at myself in the mirror and knowing that I&#39;m still alive is the best thing I have right now.&quot;</p>', 'Beirut, Olypmics', 'Beirut blast olymp_1599651732.jpg', '2020-09-09 15:42:12', '2021-08-14 06:45:55'),

Since then, China has suspended some of Australia&#39;s top beef imports and has warned students and tourists not to travel to the &quot;racist&quot; country. This week a man from Australia was sentenced to death for drug trafficking in a secret trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led to an insane debate in Australia: is China retaliating against accusations of manipulating the coronavirus?

Canberra has recently raised concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, barring Chinese company Huawei from establishing Australia&#39;s 5G network and discussing allegations that Beijing has infiltrated the interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This friction is not unique to Australia. Canada, Japan and South Korea - among others - have experienced economic rejection from China, ostensibly for political reasons. However, Australia&#39;s economic dependence on China is greater than many other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past decade, China has been Australia&#39;s biggest trading partner and now accounts for 32.6% of its exports. Australian mines already supply iron ore, coal and gas to drive Chinese growth - favored by competitors in Brazil for their quality and geographic proximity. This is an agreement that benefits both countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other sectors - education, tourism, agriculture, wine - are also booming in the Chinese market. But like barley, they are less exclusive to Australia and more prone to political tensions, economists say. All of this has sparked debate about whether Australia is too dependent on China and whether Australia should look for other trading partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This needs to drastically strengthen relations with Asia&#39;s neighbors, said Dr. Lai-Ha Chan, political scientist at Sydney University of Technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was trying, he said, noting that Prime Minister Scott Morrison was planning a trip to India this year and had repeatedly asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for information. His visit to Vietnam last year - the first by an Australian leader in 25 years - should recognize its rising star as a market economy, he added. Australian ecotourism and the university sector is actively promoting the two countries. Dr. Chan suggested that Australia could count on a combination of these countries - plus Indonesia, Japan and South Korea - to reduce dependence on China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/10E4C/production/_112869196_gettyimages-1179902084.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently not all of them are in Australia&#39;s top 10 trading partners. In most cases there is no free trade agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, economists refute the idea that the Chinese market can easily be replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India has often been cited for its potential. Australia has set a target of $ 45 billion Australian dollars (&pound; 25 billion; $ 31 billion) in annual exports to India by 2035. Last year, however, more than A $ 160 billion was sold in China alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no other option that comes close to finding numbers in China,&quot; said Professor Jane Golly, a specialist in Chinese economics at the Australian National University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attempts at government (a practice observed in Japan) are a waste of money, say economists. &quot;It&#39;s a little strange for the government to tell companies that you can&#39;t sell to China or have to sell more to other countries when other countries don&#39;t try to buy,&quot; said Dr. Shiro Armstrong, an East Asia specialist. BBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian companies are already working hard to reduce their dependence on China, added Dirk van der Kley of the political research group China Matters, citing the university in particular. &quot;Of course they make a little difference. But the market is important here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More options with China?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Goli believes that calls by some security analysts to turn away from China - which is being covered by the media - are &quot;sad&quot;. &quot;I wonder if the people on the street reading the headlines think we have to stand out from China. I always wonder if they are thinking about what this means and how it can lead to it. They or their children are no longer able to. have a job in the future. &quot;. &quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Australia and other countries, Australia is better served if you look at the bigger picture. It is much less dependent on exports (20% of GDP) than many countries. However, this income flows directly to jobs and wealth, making China the main engine of Australia&#39;s prosperity. Richard Maude, a former head of foreign affairs for the Australian government, said it was important that Australia could work with China on food security, energy and climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Van Der Clay predicts that markets other than China&#39;s middle class will emerge in Australia, particularly in sectors such as healthcare and nursing. Australia&#39;s significant Chinese diaspora should not be overlooked, said another. Australia is home to more than 1.2 million people of Chinese descent, many of whom have emigrated in the last decade alone - creating deep connections with the community. Chinese consumers continue to choose Australia for education and tourism, for this reason too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politically, however, there is consensus that Canberra-Beijing relations have fallen to their lowest level in decades. Despite repeated requests from Australia, three years have passed since the bilateral meeting of heads of state and government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/CBE4/production/_112869125_gettyimages-521114682.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" />Professor Goli said the government should work hard to help Australian companies connect with Chinese counterparts, but feared this would be impacted by &quot;deteriorating&quot; political relations. Others say Australia needs to be more strategic in diplomacy - for example, being able to criticize China from a group of like-minded people rather than go on strike alone. They also suggested that Prime Minister Scott Morrison should arrest Government Hawks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, in the end, brilliant diplomacy is just &quot;packaging,&quot; said Maud, a former diplomat: &quot;China still often objects to what&#39;s in it, no matter how well packaged.&quot; Morrison said, &quot;We are just Australians. We haven&#39;t done anything, nor have we tried to do anything that goes against our values, or we have tried in any way to antagonize our partnership with China.&quot; &quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia hasn&#39;t changed, but China has fundamentally changed, said Maude. He claims Beijing is becoming more self-confident and authoritarian. Canberra, like other democracies, can no longer ignore the political realities of economic gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The risk of economic retaliation will become a permanent feature of the &#39;new norm&#39; in relations,&quot; he said. &quot;We also can&#39;t drink and eat the cake.&quot; But for Mr. Kelly on the barley farm, he felt like the proverbial canary in the gold mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have been concerned for years - this has been going on for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;The worst case scenario appears to have occurred.&quot;</p>', 'China Australia, Relationship', 'Australia China_1599652395.png', '2020-09-09 15:53:16', '2021-08-15 19:09:19'),

Intervention laws were followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrison is now following the same zigzag path - harsh in China in its own language, but has to accept the harsh reality that China still offers the best potential bet for the country&#39;s future prosperity. And as demonstrated in his meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang this week, courtesy almost always returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is that a problem?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the country in 2014, he finally stood before Parliament in Canberra and said they needed to be more ambitious and courageous in their vision for China. And China likes things like the rule of law and institutions that Australia can predict. Why try to violate this attribute?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the problem is size. The emergence of China as a key player, perhaps a key player for Australia - a country of only 24 million people with a large area around the coast for police and a fleet of only 27,000 people - will always be puzzling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add to this the combination, the manner in which this whole phenomenon creates some deep, but often hidden, flaws in the Australian national soul. This is a country that until recently, despite its geographic location, should never have been considered Asian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe has been a major source of migration for decades, and America has been a security and a large part of its economic growth. Australia is now accepting a large number of new nationals whose families are from the region, including many from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian universities are a good case. Some have thousands of Chinese students, which means that these usually liberal institutions depend on funding from interest groups of very different values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent documentary Four Corners published on ABC national television contained almost paranoid allegations that a large number of these groups were at security risk because of their political interference and the way they work as technology spies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canberra to deal with foreign interference in universities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m in Australia but I feel censored&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why the university angered Chinese students</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been cases when some scientists were under pressure when discussing topics such as Taiwan, Hong Kong or Xinjiang. The Chinese government and its agents have been violent at times. However, it is easy to see why some Chinese may be confused because their contribution to the coffers of the country where they are learning and acquiring new skills is interpreted so frighteningly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenges for Australia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple fact is that no Australian leader has ever really seen another part of the Chinese equation. If it suits them, they want to talk about the threat this new and very different partner poses to values ​​and worldviews. But they tend not to talk about their own country&#39;s fears and the problems it has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only Abbott provided a vivid picture of it when, in a moment of untainted honesty, on camera of Angela Merkel, she said Australia&#39;s attitude toward China was marked by &quot;fear and greed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia can avoid investment, students and opportunities from China, and sometimes - Huawei is one example. Trying to do this on a grand scale, however, and seeking partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, for example, would mean great sacrifice and a huge reorientation of its way of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrison now appears to be following in the footsteps of his predecessors and taking a very controversial stance.

Minority for the growing racist tensions in the nation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent public opinion polls show that a large proportion of Americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction. This is poison for the incumbent president who wants to be re-elected. Trump warned that Biden would &quot;crush&quot; the American dream&nbsp; Republicans, from the president downwards, have tried to prove that things are really good and for the better - or at least that they&#39;re going to get significantly worse with Democrat Joe Biden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a tall order, but here are six ways the president and his party are trying to meet them.&nbsp; I sell Covid-19 as a success story There have been nearly six million cases of Covid-19 and more than 180,000 deaths in the United States. It&#39;s a cold and hard fact that Trump and the Republican Party spent the week talking. For the first time ever, party leaders such as Mike Pence, Melania Trump and President Trump himself have shown sympathy for lost loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a nation we grieve, we grieve and we forever hold memories of all the lives in our hearts that were tragically taken away,&quot; Trump said. &quot;In his honor we will unite. In his memory we will win.&quot;&nbsp;Republicans have focused on steps the president is taking such as banning some travel from China to the US (even though commercial flights have been suspended), streamlining and coordinating therapeutic research, the $ 750 million just announced for the new fast. Coronavirus test results and speak of the upcoming miracle of American ingenuity - vaccines - before the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from a cursory mention by the President himself during a segment at the White House on Monday, they ignored previously promised breakthroughs such as hydroxychloroquine and missed the fact that the head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is restoring the healing benefits of plasma, which the President highlighted on Sunday. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many speakers referred to past coronavirus pandemics and suggested - or perhaps hoped - that the worst was over. &quot;We provide life-saving therapy and will prepare a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe sooner,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We will beat the virus, end the pandemic and come out stronger than ever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The re-election of the president is dependent on American voters believing him, even though the virus continues to wreak havoc in the United States - far worse than many other developed nations around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Promises further economic benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in the year, in its 127th month of enlargement, the 2020 Presidential campaign had to work hard with the US economy to give the president another four-year term. Everything changed with the pandemic. The United States is currently in the midst of a record recession with double-digit unemployment and falling consumer confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are signs of life, and Trump and Republicans were quick to say that this week. The stock market reaches new heights and the company&#39;s acquisitions are back. Opinion polls show the president still scores his best in terms of how he handles the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the main focus of the Republican Convention appears to be to remind Americans of pre-pandemic economic achievements - the 2017 tax cut bill, renegotiation of trade deals with Canada, Mexico, and South Korea, and what was once a record - low unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Has Trump kept his election promises?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican Party&#39;s main argument is that all was well during the first three years of the Trump&nbsp; administration, so he&#39;s the one who can fix it. &quot;In a new term as president,&quot; Trump said in his acceptance speech, &quot;we will rebuild the largest economy in history - we will soon achieve full employment, increase incomes and prosper again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, as Pence said more succinctly on Wednesday, Trump &quot;will make America great again. Again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Racial make-up</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time at the White House, Trump had mixed results in racing. Although the government helped pass bipartisan laws to reform criminal justice through Congress, opponents of the president&#39;s words - and especially his tweets - accuse him of frequently undermining his actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They cited the president&#39;s cold-blooded efforts to respond to the message behind the recent protests against police brutality and systemic racism as further evidence of his indifference to the concerns of the black community. This week Republicans made a determined effort to portray the president as a de facto supporter of this community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Night after night, a congressional spokesman claimed personally and professionally that Trump was taking care of black Americans. Former soccer star Herschel Walker, Senator Tim Scott, Kentucky Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, Secretary of State for Housing, Ben Carson, White House official, Ja&#39;Ron Smith - these are probably the main focus of the modern Republican convention on black courts To reach voters .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Donald Trump cares deeply about the lives of black people,&quot; said Clarence Henderson, a 1960s civil rights activist who spoke at Congress late Wednesday. &quot;His politics shows his heart.&quot; In a somewhat controversial display of presidential power during political conventions, Trump pardoned John Ponder, a convicted criminal who is now running a program to help former prisoners return to society and perform citizenship ceremonies for various immigrant groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message in question was clear - as was the strategic point. In 2016, black voters made up 10% of the electorate, with 90% voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. If Trump can prevent Democratic support in this demographic, it will really pay off - especially in the Mediterranean state, which the president won four years ago. Praise from the black community may also help relieve moderate Republicans who are worried about Trump&#39;s racial segregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In three years I have done more for the black community in 47 years than Joe Biden,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And if I am re-elected, the best will still come.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than three months, racial issues have been a growing fire in the United States, a fire the President occasionally ignites despite a four-day convention. The recent riots in Wisconsin could suggest that if the president is re-elected, there will be more protests and clashes like him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President of Law and Order Four years ago, in a speech to Congress, Trump promised that &quot;the crime and violence affecting our nation will end soon&quot;. In his opening speech, he said that &quot;this American massacre stops here and now&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, three and a half years later, violent crimes erupted in several cities across the United States, and protests against police brutality have sometimes turned ugly. Therefore, the president argues it&#39;s the fault of the state and local Democrats - and voters can send them a message by re-electing Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Your choice will determine whether you protect law-abiding Americans or give free rein to anarchists, agitators and criminals who commit violence that threatens our citizens,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since mass protests began after George Floyd&#39;s death, presidents have focused on violence in places like Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and now Kenosha, Wisconsin, rather than the police action that triggered it. It happened again on Thursday night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his speech, the President mentioned &quot;police mistakes&quot; in passing and said the justice system would hold &quot;wrongdoers&quot; accountable. &quot;But what we will never experience is a situation where things are happening the way they are today. We must not let the crowd rule,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How the US attitude towards the police has changed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the president did not name the 17-year-old man who was accused of killing two protesters late Tuesday. And when Vice President Pence spoke about David Patrick Underwood, a murdered Oakland officer, he was implying that the protesters - not the right - were accused of the crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a growing divide in the country over who was to blame when protests swept American cities. The president said those siding with police over protesters will lead him to victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attack Biden repeatedly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If none of the Republican Party&#39;s attempts to restore its image and restore confidence in America&#39;s current state of affairs are successful, the back-up plan is to move that election from a presidential referendum to one between Trump and his Democratic opponents. To replace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Trump won despite negative reviews for approval, as his opponent Hillary Clinton was seen as equally disadvantageous. When voters who have concerns about both candidates have to vote, they mostly turn to Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of the week, Republicans such as party leaders Ron McDaniel and Pence took advantage of the lack of political detail in the Democratic Convention to label Biden a left-wing prisoner. America wouldn&#39;t be safe if Biden won - pence Trump urged Biden to take a drug test before the debate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others, such as Senators Scott and Cameron of Kentucky, have questioned his sensitivity to racial issues and threw some of Biden&#39;s more prominent racing mistakes in his face. Pence said Biden was too weak to protect the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The harsh truth is that you are not safe in America Joe Biden,&quot; said Pence. In a speech on Thursday evening, Trump repeated all of these attacks - and many more. &quot;The Biden Report is a shameful naming of the most terrible betrayal and error of our lives,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He has been on the wrong side of history throughout his career.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He paid particular attention to the Biden document in support of a free trade agreement - a hot topic for him against Clinton in 2016, especially in Midwest states. He warned that Biden would raise taxes and energy bills, encourage undocumented migration, free criminals on the streets and &quot;confiscate your weapons.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a flawed attack of varying validity in the hope that some would draw blood. &quot;Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism,&quot; Trump said. &quot;If Joe Biden doesn&#39;t have the power to fight savage Marxists like Bernie Sanders and radicals, how will he defend you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We fight them</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political space is all well and good, but modern elections are won by increasing your loyal guerrillas and attracting a fraction of the voters who haven&#39;t really made a decision. Therefore, much of the Republican Convention&#39;s rhetoric is aimed at motivating grassroots presidents - warning them that the media, big technology companies, a liberal &quot;cancellation culture&quot; and a &quot;so-called expert elite class,&quot; according to Christie, governor of South Dakota Noah, you want to bring him. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark and Patricia McCloskey, St. Louis, pointing their guns at Black Lives Matter protesters, has suggested that Democrats want the suburbs to be removed. &quot;If you defend yourself, the crowd pushed by allies in the media will try to crush you,&quot; said Patricia Makloski.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What really happened at St. Louis that day?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his speech on Wednesday, Pence said Trump would protect America&#39;s heritage. &quot;If you want a president who keeps quiet when our legacy is insulted or insulted, he is not your man,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complaints are always part of the fuel that drives Trump&#39;s rise - his followers feel like they are missing something valuable, and the most extraordinary politician, Donald Trump, is the one who will help them defend it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Always remember,&quot; Trump said, repeating the line he had said earlier, &quot;you follow me because I fight for you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a recipe for a collapsed campaign as Trump and his supporters seek a long-term and brutal struggle to defend the presidency. President Trump claims his Democratic rival for the presidency, Joe Biden, supports the idea of ​​rejecting the police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Biden said he would not take money from the police. He wants to invest in public projects and social programs to free the police. Since George Floyd&#39;s death by a Minneapolis police officer in May, calls have been made to divert money from police to spend on other services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What did Biden promise about police funds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The June 8 statement from the Biden communications team supports the need for reform, with a focus on funding education programs, as well as mental health and drug treatment projects, to focus the work of police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These programs should be separated from police funds, he said. Biden&#39;s campaign website also pledged a $ 300 million investment in community police, which relies on recruiting police officers who &quot;reflect the racial diversity of the community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also provides additional funding for body-worn police cameras. Seven ideas for reforming the American police force. In a June interview with CBS News, Biden said he does not support police protection, adding, &quot;I support giving government assistance to the police depending on whether they meet some basic standards of decency or not ...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Biden also wrote a statement to USA Today last month saying, &quot;While I don&#39;t believe that federal dollars should go to police departments that violate human rights or use violence as the first example, I do not support the police&#39;s defense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why was Biden accused of supporting the rejection?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interview Biden gave in July led to accusations that he helped take money from the police after Republican Congressman Steve Scalis posted a revised version on Twitter. In this version, Mr. Biden answers the question whether he agreed to the transfer of funds with a &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Trump made reference to this when referring to the Republican Convention, adding that if Biden becomes president, &quot;the radical left will get rid of police departments across America. However, the video posted by Mr Scalis was deemed defaced by Twitter because the words &quot;for police&quot; were edited in connection with the funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the unedited original, interviewer Ady Barkan said, &quot;We can reduce the responsibility given to the police and shift some of the police funds towards social services, psychological counseling and affordable housing.&quot;&nbsp;Joe Biden talks about the different kinds of police reform he wants to see when Mr Barkan stops asking, &quot;But do we agree we can divert some of the funds?&quot; He didn&#39;t mention the word &quot;police&quot; in the question, but Mr. Biden answered nonetheless, &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican Steve Scalis deleted his Twitter post with the video, but maintained his view that Biden was talking about police funding. The Biden campaign called the edited video a &quot;big fake.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who supports police protection?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several prominent Democrats who support cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes supports the denial of police service and reinvesting money in local communities. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken steps to save $ 1 billion from the city&#39;s law enforcement agencies by diverting funds to youth programs - although Congressman Ocasio-Cortes said this was achieved through &quot;budget tricks&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has taken $ 150 million from the police department&#39;s budget to spend on other local programs. In other cities such as Washington, San Francisco and Baltimore, local politicians have expressed support for some form of opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven ideas for reforming the American police force</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are cities in the United States experiencing an increase in violent crime?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in Minneapolis, the city council has promised to dismantle the entire police department, although it is not yet clear what will replace it. The Black Lives Matter movement launched a petition to undermine the police, saying, &quot;We are calling for the protection of the national police. We want to invest in our community and resources to ensure that black people not only survive but thrive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defundation advocates believe that spending more on education, housing and health care than law enforcement will help reduce crime, meaning fewer police officers are needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, critics say the kidnapping will not include the reforms needed to train and operate police officers, nor will it improve the functioning of police in society. They also said that simply withdrawing money from the police could make people living in areas with high crime rates more vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much money did the police authorities get?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the fees to the police department come directly from local governments, the rest from federal government grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent data, compiled by the Washington-based research organization Urban Institute, shows that an estimated $ 115 billion was spent on police in the United States in 2017. This number has continued to increase over the last 50 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, crime rates have decreased across the country since the 1990s, although the number of homicides in several US cities this year has increased year over year. A recent poll found that 60% of Americans oppose cutting police budgets and reallocating money for other social programs.</p>', 'Donald Trump, Speech, Republic Party', 'RNc_1599658002.jpg', '2020-09-09 17:26:42', '2021-08-13 00:35:23'),

However, Downing Street said it would allow ministers to unilaterally decide which specific goods are &quot;at risk&quot; of entering the EU when crossing Britain and Northern Ireland and are therefore subject to EU tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law would also give ministers the power to cancel export declarations for goods transported from Northern Ireland to the UK, and would make it clear that EU state aid requirements - when the government financially supports domestic companies in business - apply only in Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government, however, insisted that the bill only took &quot;limited and reasonable steps&quot; to &quot;clear up ambiguity&quot; - and not &quot;revoke&quot; the withdrawal agreement, as government sources suggested on Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&#39;s the reaction like?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brussels is concerned about reports from Downing Street.

It made a pledge and signed a treaty on the treaty for Northern Ireland and now appears to be leaving it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Scotland&#39;s first minister, Nicholas Sturgeon, said the move would &quot;greatly increase the likelihood of leaving a transitional period without a trade deal&quot; and &quot;the resulting economic damage will be entirely caused by the Tories. What a con&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a government source told the BBC that the law was &quot;not meant to derail negotiations,&quot; and a spokesman said Britain would continue to approach negotiations with the EU in good faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a responsible government, we are considering alternatives if this is not achieved to protect the people of Northern Ireland,&quot; he added.</p>', 'Brexit Law, EU Trade', 'EU trade plans_1599658247.jpg', '2020-09-09 17:30:47', '2021-08-15 18:01:06'),

I just thought: does anyone know how dangerous that is? She shared when she saw that global beauty brands had published content filtered from influencers promoting their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want kids to grow up thinking they are not good enough because of what they see on social media.&quot; The 28-year-old from Bristol turns to his Instagram show to post &quot;online conversations.&quot; The response was so good that he organized a #filterdrop campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then it exploded. It&#39;s phenomenal to see a series of realistic and honest photos,&quot; said Miss Palari. He asked people to upload unfiltered photos to their Instagram account and &quot;rate who they are by their appearance&quot;. &quot;We just don&#39;t see enough normal skin,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s fine for me to take pictures without makeup and without filters, but for some women who do ... well, one of them said it&#39;s scarier than having a baby.&quot; Elementary school teacher Katie McGrath has been following Miss Palari on social media for about a year. She never thought her nightly Instagram scrolling would be her job, but she&#39;s doing it this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Towards the end of the blockade, I received emails from parents expressing my concern about changes in their child&#39;s behavior,&quot; said McGrath. &quot;The email continues that the child has a problem with his appearance. I am amazed. This child is four, only four years old. &quot;Then I felt even sadder because our children realized how they looked at such a young age.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 29-year-old man from Cumbran, South Wales found that the student had seen makeup classes on social media. &quot;[She] talked to me about how she dislikes her face without makeup and wants to change her hair color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;#Filterdrop came in here and saved me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I feel like I can talk to students about the confidence of whatever I&#39;m personally trying to take away from the campaign.&quot; The four-year-old then asked Miss McGrath why she wears makeup every day, a question she couldn&#39;t answer. The following week he went to school with an &quot;innocent face&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I couldn&#39;t have done this without the confidence of the Sasha campaign,&quot; he said. Miss McGrath is just one of hundreds of women who responded to Miss Palari&#39;s campaign with stories of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model said she was given the strength to keep trying to tackle a problem she once considered &quot;too big.&quot; Miss Palari&#39;s video for the #filterdrop Instagram campaign has been viewed by nearly 50,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was overwhelmed with messages from supporters, many of whom didn&#39;t realize how much they were connected to the filter until asked not to use it. One woman who replied, a 33-year-old mother from Glasgow, had stopped allowing others to photograph her about three years ago - around the same time she started observing and tracking the hugely influential fitness and beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I really wanted to be one of those women who supports what Sasha is doing, but when I opened my camera I cried because I was physically disgusted by the man who was staring at me,&quot; she said. &quot;I can&#39;t stand the idea of ​​having this image there so people can rate and compare it with a large modified image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NHS staff member said she had experienced physical, psychological and emotional abuse in the past and &quot;her pride was not where it should be&quot;. &quot;There are so many people who feel like me, rely heavily on filters, and stare at the path of dysmorphism,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mental health needs to be a national focus. We have no reason not to know how this unhealthy perception has the potential to provoke and negatively impact our younger generations.&quot; Another Miss Palari follower, Zia Hutchings, said, &quot;Sasha started sharing something on her Instagram through a filtering campaign and I realized that I really hated my face, one without makeup and two without filters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have seen so many beautiful girls or models on social media with perfect skin, perfect nose and perfect figure. I have freckles, sun-damaging pigmentation, and babies,&quot; said the 27-year-old woman. &quot;At first I didn&#39;t have the courage to take part, then one night I was very scared by my real face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have an 18 month old daughter. If I can&#39;t share a photo of my face without makeup and filters, how can I expect her to truly love each other?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The thought breaks my heart.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Palari hopes the campaign will have three results: The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) needs influential social media to declare whether they use filters to advertise cosmetics; Remove face change and morphing filters from Instagram; and &quot;see what&#39;s more realistic on Instagram.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[The use of filters] is often not announced, so people keep thinking, &ldquo;Why don&#39;t I look like this? &quot;And that&#39;s because they don&#39;t sell the truth,&quot; said Miss Palari. He didn&#39;t want to see the end of the filter, but said some face morphing filters &quot;shouldn&#39;t be around&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One recent one that I found weakens my nose, weakens my face, and is very realistic,&quot; he said. I never thought my nose was big and I looked at it and I thought &quot;maybe it&#39;s big&quot; ... so how would that spoil it for someone who lacks confidence?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On social media, we have a responsibility to make that change. We choose what we put there. &quot;If this filter has to be declared, the cycle can be broken.&quot; Instead of &quot;naming and shaming&quot; companies that use filters, Miss Palari wants to send direct messages to brands using filters or republish photos that use filters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said there were mixed reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASA confirmed that after contacting Ms. Palari, they investigated whether the use of filters in Instagram ads &quot;misleadingly transmits the effectiveness of cosmetic products&quot;. He adds, &quot;While it is perfectly legal for influencers to use a post-production style in advertising, it is important that filters do not mislead or exaggerate product achievements. We will publish our research results from time to time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked to comment on the negative impact of the filter on Instagram, the social media platform said it had taken steps to reduce social pressure, including testing the removal of &quot;likes&quot; to fit comparison culture. zoom out. and review research and trends to tailor their policies &quot;as needed&quot;. A statement said: &quot;We want the effects of Augmented Reality (AR) to be a safe and positive experience for our community and for developers to be able to express themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s why we allow people to create and use face modification effects on Instagram, but we don&#39;t recommend them in our Effects Gallery. So many people find them.&quot; Responding to the comments, Miss Palari said, &quot;It is a pity that there is still not sufficient acknowledgment of the dangers of Face Alteration and Face Morphing filters, whether they appear in the Effects Gallery or not. They can still be found or not.&quot; It is very easy just by just by doing it. associate it with simple words like &quot;beautiful&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Filters are most often used by developers and influencers with the largest platforms to reach people who are much more impressive with their stories than by finding filters. &quot;I hope that we will immediately take responsibility for how much weakening the nose in less than five seconds can undermine our confidence.&quot;</p>', 'Instagram, Photo filters, campaign', 'Instagram_1599658497.jpg', '2020-09-09 17:34:57', '2021-08-14 22:39:24'),

Odelay, notwithstanding being assigned, passed on this one uninvolved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1997&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Won: Bob Dylan, Time Out Of Mind&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ought to have won: Radiohead, OK Computer&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, Bob Dylan revived a hailing muse with Time Out Of Mind, a collection which saw him blending up with maker Daniel Lanois, the Canadian who had delivered U2 during the 80s and helmed Dylan&#39;s own Oh Mercy collection in 1989. The collection carried a more test sheen to Dylan&#39;s work &ndash; Lanois, all things considered, was enormously engaged with U2&#39;s Achtung Baby &ndash; however the by and large sure audits included some who thought about whether the record was less a Dylan show-stopper and more an exhibition of Lanois&#39; ability in the studio. Radiohead, then again, had delivered a LP broadly viewed as truly outstanding of the decade: Pink Floyd levels of existential sadness as the clock ticked nearer to the furthest limit of the thousand years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2000&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Won: Steely Dan, Two Against Nature&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ought to have won: Eminem, The Marshall Mathers LP, or Radiohead, Kid A&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steely Dan were properly praised for their splendid, brilliant, jazz-touched interpretation of pop. Quite a bit of that praising, obviously, occurred during the 1970s, when the couple of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen delivered their most suffering work. After 1980&#39;s Gaucho they considered it daily for a long time, before rejoining for shows and, inevitably, another collection, 2000&#39;s Two Against Nature. However, the collection came out the exact year as one of the most questionable &ndash; and top rated &ndash; hip-jump collections ever, Eminem&#39;s third collection The Marshall Mathers LP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiohead had additionally been up for dispute with Kid An, a sideways turn from the fate loaded present day prog of OK Computer into more electronic domains; it&#39;s today viewed as a drastically fruitful sideways advance, and a great of the electronic class.

Similarly that neglected veteran chiefs here and there get an Oscar for lesser, later work, the Grammys can compensate specialists for their proceeded with nearness. It&#39;s additionally conceivable that the torment of losing blue legend Ray Charles &ndash; who passed on in June 2004 &ndash; brought Genius Loves Company into sharp help when it was delivered after death a couple of months after the fact. It was a loose yet unspectacular two part harmonies record, blending Charles with any semblance of Willie Nelson, Norah Jones and Diana Krall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could contend that two great collections of that year could have won the prize. Franz Ferdinand&#39;s eponymous presentation was a certified sensation, a hit record over the globe, and the ideal refining of frontman Alex Kapranos&#39; craving to compose tunes &quot;your sweetheart will move to&quot;, precise and intriguing but then loaded down with radio-accommodating snares. Kanye West&#39;s The College Dropout, then, remains apparently his imaginative apex. Recorded more than four years while West was repelled by record mark after record name, The College Dropout effervesced with determined vitality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2007&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Won: Herbie Hancock, River: The Joni Letters&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ought to have won: Amy Winehouse, Back To Black&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On paper, Amy Winehouse&#39;s characterizing collection, Back To Black, was impeccable Grammy grain.

The guitar solo, or all the more precisely a guitar thunder, is deserving of Neil Young at his pinnacle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critical verse: &quot;It&#39;s not the open weaving/Nor the heater shine/Nor the blood of you seeping/As you attempt to give up.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>18.

Gone is immovably in the last camp, the two pop free thinkers making an inflexible, existential enemy of social song of praise. It&#39;s a cooperative cri de coeur about the heaviness of desire, with the tenacious electro-funk beat giving the ideal soundtrack to their therapy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important verse: &quot;Am I a smoke?

Tyler, The Creator, Earfquake&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially composed considering Justin Beiber, and later offered to and dismissed by Rhianna, Earfquake finds the rapper singing in misfortune mode, arguing a sweetheart not to leave over summer sounds and harmonies. His brand name sound is helped by vocals from R&amp;B legend Charlie Wilson, Devont&eacute; Hyne and (notably, untranscribable) advertisement libs from Playboi Carti.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential verse: &quot;You don&#39;t need no inconvenience, no/I don&#39;t need no side data/I simply need to realize what&#39;s going on/&#39;cause I&#39;m seriously.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Sharon Van Etten, Seventeen&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A self-announced love letter to New York, Seventeen is up there among Van Etten&#39;s best work. It&#39;s for any individual who has ever looked once more into their past and stressed whether age has improved them. With Van Etten you don&#39;t exactly know the appropriate response, yet let&#39;s be honest such is reality, and Van Etten splendidly catches the mixed, confused feelings among sentimentality and knowing the past.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important verse: &quot;I recognize what you&#39;re going to be/You&#39;ll fold it up just to see/Afraid that you&#39;ll be much the same as me!&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Vampire Weekend, Harmony Hall&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A track that is what could be compared to opening the window ornaments and letting the spring sun sparkle in, Harmony Hall sees the band unobtrusively refining their sound, with Ezra Koenig&#39;s generally piercing and available verses to date. In the event that you like the acoustic guitar riff, cheer, there&#39;s two hours-worth of it here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noteworthy verse: &quot;Outrage needs a voice/Voices wanna sing/Singers orchestrate/Until they can&#39;t hear anything.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Lana Del Rey, The best&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A blow song of devotion for the wore out age. Del Rey zeroed in her swooning true to life style on the American Dream, or what she believes is left of it. The Greatest takes a dismal and elegiac perspective on a nation overwhelmed by political uneasiness, environmental change, superstar culture, and even the bogus alert of an atomic assault on Hawaii. The end times may not be currently, however in Del Rey&#39;s hands it feels both appalling and delightful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critical verse: &quot;The way of life is lit and I let loose/I surmise that I&#39;m worn out all things considered.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Rosal&iacute;a accomplishment J Balvin and El Guincho, Con Altura&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosal&iacute;a has been causing a ripple effect with her contemporary interpretation of flamenco, yet this is the melody that put her on the worldwide guide. An easy combination of conventional music with old-school reggaet&oacute;n and a scramble of Middle-Eastern motivation, Rosal&iacute;a made a sound every last bit of her own &ndash; a sound that feels a great deal like the fate of worldwide popular music.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant verse: &quot;Vivo r&aacute;pido y no tengo cura/Ir&eacute; joven dad&#39; la sepulture.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Clairo, Bags&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separating is difficult to do, and now and then significantly harder to clarify. The lead Rostam Batmanglij-delivered single from Clairo&#39;s collection Immunity, painfully investigates the sort of unimportant, implicit things that amass and combine into the second when a friend or family member leaves the entryway with those sacks. Serene, contacting and genuine, the tune raised the 21-year-old from You Tube marvel to true blue pop star.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential verse: &quot;Would you be able to see me? I&#39;m sitting tight for the opportune time/I can&#39;t understand you, however on the off chance that you need, the delight&#39;s all mine.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Lil Nas X accomplishment Billy Ray Cyrus, Old Town Road (Remix)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love it, scorn it, or even love to loathe it, you can&#39;t deny the melody&#39;s mastery in 2019.

The team quickly switches among Spanish and another dialect &ndash; however it isn&#39;t English, the global language of hip-bounce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other language is Palenquero, one of the two creole dialects local to Colombia.

Kombilesa Mi additionally has a solid presence, says Padilla Julio, among the Palenque diaspora in the capital Bogot&aacute;. What&#39;s more, the gathering has visited abroad, setting up rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero as a melodic type, however a more extensive social development interfacing past to introduce for crowds both inside and outside Palenque.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kombilesa Mi are showing individuals Palenquero words by consolidating them into their tunes (Credit: Fernando Decilles)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kombilesa Mi are showing individuals Palenquero words by fusing them into their melodies (Credit: Fernando Decilles)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For quite a long time, San Basilio de Palenque has been an image of opposition, one that radiates through in its language, culture, and character.

On the rest of the non-weekend days, the gatherings offers music and move classes. &quot;We do this so the children can grow up with a strong character,&quot; says Guillermo Camacho, director of Kombilesa Mi. &quot;Our work is to reinforce Palenquero character through music and language has consistently been a component that is permitted us to fortify our locale.&quot; The gathering likewise deals with network paintings, which regularly include states in Palenquero.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the thing that the town&#39;s occupants have been searching for quite a while &ndash; Padilla Julio&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero is at the core of these activities.

This, he clarifies, is a result of its combination with Palenque culture and custom instead of earlier endeavors to impersonate hip-bounce from different nations, for example, Venezuela, Cuba, or the United States. Most importantly, rap folkl&oacute;rico palenquero has helped the network discover that hip-jump is a type that urges its audience members to &quot;speak more loudly and dissent&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Camacho, this capacity to scrutinize business as usual reverberates with the lives of Palenque speakers, from helpless water and electric frameworks to social assignment. &quot;What is being free when you don&#39;t approach training, to medical services, to steady employments?&quot; he inquires. &quot;I don&#39;t get freedom&#39;s meaning when they oppress you due to the shade of your skin?&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is trust that hip-jump will make the language more pertinent to more youthful individuals (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is trust that hip-bounce will make the language more applicable to more youthful individuals (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of the fact that longstanding, these fundamental issues &ndash; to a degree &ndash; are amplified following the 2016 international agreements, which finished a 52-year rebellion by guerrilla rebels from the left-wing Farc. &quot;The issue isn&#39;t only the guerrilla,&quot; says Camacho. There are different types of savagery created against the network, bigotry and separation regardless. Camacho includes that the continuous homicide of social activists and pioneers in Afro and Indigenous people group &ndash; hundreds since the 2016 arrangement &ndash; is the same old thing. &quot;It&#39;s smarter to remove our way, since we are arousing different networks, different pioneers,&quot; says Padilla Julio. That is the reason music has become such an amazing asset.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kombilesa Mi are right now planning for the arrival of their subsequent collection, entitled Esa Palenquera.

The Atlanta rapper, conceived Jeffery Lamar Williams, has been a developing power in hip-jump for the majority of 10 years. His in a split second unmistakable alto has been crawling and slithering its way up the outlines for just about 10 years, however the most recent two years have seen Thug ascend to turn into the sun lord at the focal point of rap&#39;s nearby planetary group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, Young Thug turned into his own sort. He won his first Grammy for sponsorship vocals and promotion libs on Childish Gambino&#39;s This is America. Hooligan&#39;s last collection So Much Fun appeared at number one in the United States, a business climax that showed the craftsman&#39;s melodic differentiations in the entirety of their greatness. It&#39;s his response to Lil Wayne&#39;s profession characterizing Tha Carter III, a cleverly built refining of his intrigue &ndash; more royal celebration than a work of art &ndash; weakening his wild experimentation for a limited fluorescent happiness that could speak to rural teenagers finding vape pens and rap just because.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as fixing the collection outline, he quickly involved 11 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, including his Post Malone joint effort, Goodbyes, which despite everything gets over a million streams day by day. But, Thugga&#39;s most noteworthy heritage is his multitude of imitators; youthful specialists who found that there&#39;s cash and distinction to be produced using peculiar rhymes and unusual sounds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid 2010s Thug rose up out of Atlanta, the city that has generally established the pace for hip-jump over this decade. The traditional story around Thug&#39;s show liquefying shrieks and chatters consistently thought about him unreasonably extraterrestrial, quirky, and antagonistic to the limited time requests needed to turn into the graph besting celebration featuring star that his ability justified.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youthful Thug even showed up on Childish Gambino&#39;s This Is America, one of the decade&#39;s greatest tracks (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youthful Thug even showed up on Childish Gambino&#39;s This Is America, one of the decade&#39;s greatest tracks (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the tenth of 11 kids from the Jonesboro South activities in Atlanta has gotten omnipresent on the Spotify US Top 50, in any event, when he&#39;s not on display. Consider Camilla Cabello, the ex-Fifth Harmony artist &ndash; her greatest performance record is Havana, her 2017 joint effort with Young Thug. Or on the other hand Drake, the most financially effective rapper of the decade, who has over and again cribbed Thug&#39;s tricky electric-eel rhythms, most prominently on a year ago&#39;s track Mob Ties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In rap, impact ordinarily starts territorially and extends outward. In this way, it&#39;s obvious that for all intents and purposes each ongoing Atlanta craftsman owes paternity to the rapper quickly known as SEX. Take February&#39;s Three Headed Snake from Gunna, a rapper marked to Young Thug&#39;s name YSL. A year ago, Gunna and another Thug prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Lil Baby, broke past the Rolling Loud talk with Drip Too Hard, an informal side project of Future and Thug&#39;s Drippin on Me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, even somebody as progressive as Thugger couldn&#39;t have existed without his recognized symbol, Lil&#39; Wayne&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distinction between praise, impersonation, and apprenticeship may remain everlastingly dim. The old rap line held that no gnawing was permitted was summarized by Wu Tang Clan&#39;s Raekwon: &quot;I don&#39;t need nobody seeming like me on no collection.&quot; A more equanimous view originated from TS Eliot: &quot;Youthful writers mimic; develop artists take; awful artists damage what they take, and great artists improve it into something, or if nothing else something else.&quot; Even somebody as progressive as Thugger couldn&#39;t have existed without his recognized symbol, Lil Wayne, whose slurred codeine hexes fragmented rap&#39;s prospects in a thousand ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuning in to Thug&#39;s first mixtapes from the earliest starting point of the decade, the mythical serpent in-couture croak and Jabberwocky rhyme conspires that followed are missing. It&#39;s completely quieted riffs on Wayne. Indeed, even on his first remarkable undertaking, 2011&#39;s I Came From Nothing 2, he stays in bondage to his legend, however tunes like Keep In Touch uncovered his boundless potential. Like the entirety of Thug&#39;s best work, the track is impervious to basic meandering aimlessly. It&#39;s based on doggy canine sentimentalism that could have originated from Motown&hellip; on the off chance that it were seized by a 6-foot-4-inch nose-ringed, betting fixated, ex-secondary school quarterback from the ghettos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youthful Thug&#39;s rapping style owes a lot to his antecedent Lil&#39; Wayne (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youthful Thug&#39;s rapping style owes a lot to his antecedent Lil&#39; Wayne (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youthful Thug&#39;s advancement accompanied 2013&#39;s Stoner. It was a completely various species from what had preceded, produced from a DNA transformation whose circulatory system was equivalent amounts of strawberry happy farmer, promethazine, weed, molly, and elusive powders radiated in from the attachment on Betelgeuse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Stoner, he screeches and groans, regurgitating bad dream cantillations and euphoric howls, extending syllables until they breakdown under the pressure, vanishing into the disappearing point. He spell-shouts &quot;L-E-A-N-I-N-G&quot; like a ruined kid asking to open his Christmas presents early, however finding that the main things under the tree are Styrofoam and codeine. Hooligan&#39;s voice reshapes into neon magma; he utilizes it like Jimi Hendrix utilizing a wah-wah-pedal. It&#39;s a live force rope squirming in the road during a lightning storm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s almost difficult to think about who will wind up incredible him, or if nothing else adding a new area&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following three years denoted a run that can coordinate about any inventive streak ever. There was the Rich Gang venture with individual Atlanta MC Rich Homie Quan (whose own expressive impact is frequently neglected), which by one way or another satisfied Quan&#39;s brag that they were the &quot;hardest team since OutKast&quot;. Concerning Thug&#39;s performance work, the initial two volumes of the Slime Season arrangement are incoherently extemporized magnum opuses, frequently neglected on the grounds that like Rich Gang, they never made it onto real time features. The pinnacle may have been 2015&#39;s Barter 6, his first undertaking made accessible for business discharge. There&#39;s ostensibly his most inventive tune, Halftime, where he presents about six distinct streams, exchanging heading with the alarming nimbleness and blinding velocity of a Simone Biles floor schedule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camila Cabello (second left) is one craftsmen who has scored hits on account of Young Thug&#39;s impact (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camila Cabello (second left) is one craftsmen who has scored hits on account of Young Thug&#39;s impact (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now, his rap family hasn&#39;t caught the full summation of what has made Thug undying. Every one of his proteges appear to work inside a little bundle of his streams, tunes and vocal surfaces. It&#39;s about difficult to think about who will wind up marvellous him, or possibly adding a new area. It could be his &quot;younger siblings&quot; Gunna and Lil Baby, whose joint effort Drip or Drown 2 arrived at number three on the Billboard collection outlines prior this year. This mid year, Thug and Future reported that the younger siblings would join their seniors for a Super Slimey spin-off, framing an Atlanta rap Avengers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gauging workmanship is more perplexing and vague than simply playing a round of detect the impact&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All things considered, there is a contention that the principal half-age of Thug-impacted rappers have just changed his advancements into something particular. Travis Scott broadly cribbed Thug&#39;s Pick Up the Phone for one of his first colossal performance hits, and clearly the Houston rapper&#39;s advertisement libs, vocal pitch and songs are gotten from Thug, but mixed with 808s and Yeezus-time Kanye).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playboi Carti has gotten perhaps the greatest craftsman existing apart from everything else by locating Chicago craftsman Chief Keef with Thug. Philadelphia-conceived Lil Uzi Vert rapped like Meek Mill until he moved to Atlanta, marked to DJ Drama&#39;s name, and sprung up on Slime Season 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, gauging workmanship is more intricate and uncertain than simply playing a round of detect the impact. A hit melody like Lil Uzi Vert&#39;s XO Tour Llif3 was unmistakably educated by Uzi&#39;s own life and feelings, also the shopping center troublemaker of the most recent decade. Be that as it may, it&#39;s difficult to envision it existing or having the effect it managed without Young Thug establishing the framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eminem&#39;s eye catching VMA show in 2000: Young Thug is this current age&#39;s equal (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eminem&#39;s eye catching VMA show in 2000: Young Thug is this current age&#39;s equal (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been a long time since that MTV Music Awards where Eminem broadly raged the phase with a hundred carbon copies with dyed hair, white tees, and Levis. The thought was that he encapsulated the a great many distressed center American white young men fixated on rap, who up until that point hadn&#39;t seen themselves believably spoke to inside the class. For a year or two after Eminem exploded, each significant mark endeavored to mention their own Eminem replicant, however none endure (save for a couple of exemplary Bubba Sparxx singles).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, presently tastes and music dissemination models have changed, and with it, the longing to hear craftsmen that are better or possibly unique. In the event that you would re-try that equivalent entertainment pageant today, you may do it with 100 Young Thugs remaining in an orderly fashion in front of an audience, the outsider visionary at the cutting edge, his relatives in architect garments and colored hair, taking his sign and rapping along all the while.

After Rapper&#39;s Delight assumed control over the radio waves toward the finish of the 1970s, New York turned into the superheated focal point of this valiant new stable. All through the &#39;80s, hip-jump remained to a great extent a restricted scene. Turntablists like DJ Kool Herc were scratching and turning records in the Bronx, Run DMC were making rock-impacted tracks in Queens, and Kurtis Blow was throwing account rhymes up in Harlem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1990s saw a blast of the sound over the US. Each area built up their own sonic mark, from the vividly astounding tracks that Virginia-local Missy Elliott dropped to the hacked and screwed rhythms of Port Arthur, TX&#39;s UGK and the spirit and-gospel arched rhymes of Chicago&#39;s Common. (The year 1990 was likewise the first run through a hip-jump tune took the main spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Tragically, it was Vanilla&#39;s Ice Baby.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dizzee Rascal has carried grime to a worldwide crowd (Credit: Alamy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dizzee Rascal has carried grime to a worldwide crowd (Credit: Alamy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the point when the Millennium showed up, hip-jump began to crawl into the standard account around mainstream society. The sound was all over, as the green shoots of its global ascent were starting to show, with specialists like MIA. what&#39;s more, Dizzee Rascal turning out to be global stars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The previous decade has dug in hip jump as a lasting piece of mainstream society, yet as mainstream society itself. Hip-jump is the means by which individuals talk about themselves from Kashmir to California. The class that was once so firmly characterized has begun unlimited parts of new types. Hip-jump doesn&#39;t simply have a place with the Bronx any longer. It&#39;s all over the place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, we felt it was the perfect chance to ask pundits around the globe what they believe are the best hip-jump melodies ever. No curve balls to see that practically the entirety of the 280 melodies designated altogether are from US specialists. Yet, we additionally got designations for tunes starting external the US. As the motivation behind these rundowns ought to be to empower revelation just as discussion, we figured we would assemble a rundown of the pundit&#39;s picks from around the globe to make a worldwide playlist. Here are the champions from the pundits&#39; picks that show hip-bounce&#39;s fifty years of development into a worldwide marvel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shinjitsu No Dangan, King Giddra (1995)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because worldwide hip-jump didn&#39;t become famous until the noughties doesn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t craftsmen attempting to carry the class to their own shores. Ruler Giddra &ndash; not to be mistaken for MF DOOM&#39;s moniker King Gheedorah &ndash; was a Japanese gathering which submitted political general direction to bunches like Public Enemy, featuring the unmistakable monetary reality for some Japanese individuals in the shadow of a profound downturn. Musically, Shinjitsu No Dangan (Bullet of Truth) is a blend of East coast blast bap and the stone touched sound of Cypress Hill. Creation shrewd it may not be horribly imaginative, yet the tune is loaded with fire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Je Danse Le Mia, IAM (1994)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event that you ask any hip-jump head where the best non-English rap hails from, the appropriate response is perpetually France. IAM came to conspicuousness in the mid &#39;90s, submitting equivalent general direction to New Jack Swing and R&amp;B. Je Danse Le Mia arrived at number one in France, and remained there for quite a long time, motivating a totally different age of hip-jump craftsmen who saw that the class had star-production potential. The tune falls in line among silly and irresistible, with a funk-infused beat that wouldn&#39;t have been strange during the 1970s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italina rapper Frankie Hi-NRG MC was included at the very beginnings of Italian hip-bounce (Credit: Alamy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italina rapper Frankie Hi-NRG MC was included at the very beginnings of Italian hip-bounce (Credit: Alamy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I Luv U, Dizzee Rascal (2003)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of whether grime is hip-jump or not is a discussion that despite everything seethes today, yet nobody can contend that Dizzee Rascal carried the particularly English kind to the world&#39;s stage. The beat and stream of Dizzee&#39;s hit is proto-grime, all forceful wilderness and carport beats over fast fire rhymes that despite everything sound smooth at 140bpm. I Luv U didn&#39;t begin grime, however it catapulted it into the open awareness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soweto, Pro Kid (2005)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are rappers that set whole urban areas up for life. Think Meek Mill and Philadelphia or Drake and Toronto. Soweto&#39;s Pro Kid was another of these, advocating a territorial hip-jump style brought up in the acclaimed Johannesburg suburb. Soweto has all the triumphant strut of Jay-Z or Rick Ross rhyming over a vintage Just Blaze beat, yet Pro Kid likewise brought a particular jargon of Sowetan slang and vernacular to the table, making something grand simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most effective method to Rap About Africa, Black Vulcanite (2016)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, Kenyan writer and columnist Binyavanga Wainaina composed a satiric paper marked How to Write About Africa. It turned into a milestone bit of analysis, parodying the individuals who might go to the landmass and follow a drained equation that featured clich&eacute; stories about neediness, destruction, and debasement. After 10 years, the Namibian gathering Black Vulcanite put Wainaina&#39;s paper to music, giving it a fuming beat that submits general direction to notable makers like DJ Premier and Madlib. The subsequent track, How to Rap About Africa, is less offhanded and all the more harshly basic, bringing the mutinous fire of Public Enemy and Dead Prez to an entirely different period and topography.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sub City, Stogie T (2016)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa&#39;s hip-jump scene is one of the world&#39;s generally experienced, and it has created probably the most masterfully talented MCs this side of Queens. Yet, even in that packed field, Stogie T stands separated. The 38-year old MC broadly flexed his abilities on public broadcast Sway in the Morning, spitting an impeccable free-form over the beat from Nas&#39; NY State of Mind. It was a star-production second, however Stogie T has been rhyming since the turn of the thousand years, including the champion track Sub City from his eponymous 2016 collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuban gathering Orishas were one of the spearheading Caribbean hip-jump acts (Credit: Alamy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuban gathering Orishas were one of the spearheading Caribbean hip-jump acts (Credit: Alamy)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ngqangqa, Kanyi (2017)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As hip jump turned into a prevailing melodic power, it additionally turned into an outlet for those looking to keep their own oral and story conventions alive in a time of social homogenisation. Kanyi Mavi, a MC hailing from Cape Town, raps in Xhosa &ndash; a language expressed by in excess of 8,000,000 South Africans that contains particular &quot;click&quot; consonants. Mavi&#39;s rapping is studded with those snaps, giving the grave, coarse beat on her 2017 track Ngqangqa another layer that would be difficult to include utilizing another dialect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battle da Faida, Frankie Hi-NRG MC (1993)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy may not be the main nation you consider with regards to hip-bounce, however Frankie Hi-NRG MC has been in the game as long as unbelievable acts like Common and UGK. His presentation single is as politically charged as any Public Enemy track, railing against the impact of the mafia in Sicily on a meager, springy beat revolved around a Sly and the Family Stone example. Frankie does his best Ice Cube impact on Fight da Faida, realizing that downplayed style can be the most destroying approach to convey a rhyme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atrevido, Orishas (2000)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of the tunes on this rundown sound like American hip-jump. Atrevido, a track from Cuban rap bunch Orishas, doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s hip-bounce by craftsmen personally acquainted with Cuba&#39;s complex melodic conventions, from rumba to bolero to jazz, yielding a sound that could fit easily into quite a few classes. Orishas&#39; capacity to shape move and mix legacy with current tastes has enlivened specialists from Bad Bunny to Camilla Cabello, and made the Caribbean one of the cutting edge forces to be reckoned with of contemporary hip-bounce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More on BBC Music&#39;s most prominent hip-jump tunes ever:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 25 biggest hip-bounce tunes ever&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What pundits needed to state about the best 10&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full rundown of pundits who took an interest &ndash; and how they casted a ballot&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why Juicy is number one (not accessible in UK)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patterns and astonishments in the survey (not accessible in UK)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what reason are there not many ladies in hip-bounce surveys?

I realized a few people would get steamed. Yet, I never figured I would get called an all out supremacist for tending to their characteristic bigotry.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since showing up on the scene in 2017, OG Keemo has been to some degree an exception in the current German rap scene. The child of a Sudanese man who came to Germany in 1990, the 26-year-old is proclaimed as the future, blending his insightful verses in with road sensibilities. Experiencing childhood during the 90s between the southwestern urban communities of Mainz, Heidelberg and Mannheim (where he despite everything lives today), Keemo was raised on a careful nutritional plan of Sade, Nelly, Coltrane and 50 Cent&#39;s Get Rich or Die Tryin&#39;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unemotional cool&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elaborately, he is a MC of the post-everything kind who has aced rap as a local language in itself; the sort that makes you wonder how individuals could have ever battled to hold a beat or discover clean, multi-syllabic rhymes for each revile word in the word reference.

Rather than writing down the verses in one go, the tune comprises of different lines he&#39;s expounded on various encounters of every day bigotry for an incredible duration. It&#39;s totally held together by a repetitive reference to his dad who raised him on a &#39;using any and all means philosophy, encouraging him to &quot;never choose not to retaliate&quot;.

The beat, as consistently gave by Keemo&#39;s maker and beloved companion Funkvater Frank, comprises of minimal in excess of a couple of piano notes, shaking chains, dispersed pieces of sound plan and some ghoulish shouts at the melody&#39;s pinnacle.

Nonetheless, one could see where this hypothesis comes from; all things considered, it is Keemo, spruced up in a similar white military uniform that he&#39;s wearing toward the start of the clasp, who kicks away the seat at his own hanging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s this roundabout structure of consistently bigotry and reckless conduct that Keemo finds generally disappointing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t express we&#39;re to be accused for what&#39;s going on. Then again, I likewise don&#39;t feel &#39;It&#39;s a us-against-them situation&#39;. The exact opposite thing I needed to accomplish with this melody is make more division. However, my dad came here around 1990 and I&#39;m stunned when he reveals to me that nothing at any point transformed,&quot; he says. &quot;One of the remarks I saw most habitually was &quot;this just applies to America, never to Germany&quot;.

It&#39;s this type of unresponsiveness and numbness towards the battle of others that 216 counters with outrage coordinated at each and every individual who despite everything decides to not tune in, in any event, when they&#39;re told uproarious and clear by those influenced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That is actually what I don&#39;t comprehend&quot;, says Keemo. &quot;For instance, it could never happen to me say &#39;I don&#39;t get it, for what reason are these ladies whining out of nowhere?

These are where the political race will be won and lost and are known as battleground states.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the appointive school framework the US uses to choose its leader, each state is given various votes dependent on its populace. A sum of 538 discretionary school votes are available for anyone, so an applicant needs to hit 270 to win.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the guide above shows, some battleground states have significantly more constituent school votes on offer than others so competitors frequently invest much more energy crusading in them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the constituent school?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who&#39;s driving in the battleground states?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, surveys in the battleground states search useful for Joe Biden, however there&#39;s far to go and things can change rapidly, particularly when Donald Trump&#39;s included.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surveys recommend Mr Biden is ahead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three modern expresses his Republican adversary won by edges of under 1% to secure triumph in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, it&#39;s the battleground states where Mr Trump won large in 2016 that his mission group will be generally stressed over.

Pierre Gasley won the exciting Italian Grand Prix Louis Hamilton was responsible for the sentence Toto Wolf will remain at Mercedes in 2021</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But&nbsp; Sport News has learned that Brown and other F1 bosses are determined to carry on with the idea and give it a try later this season before using it more often in 2021.&nbsp;According to the rules in force, any changes to the rules during the championship year require unanimity. Therefore, F1 must convince Mercedes to support the plan to introduce it in one race at the end of the season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They hope that after winning the Drivers and Constructors title, the team can agree on a series of races before the season ends. The new contract the team signed last month for the period 2021-25 removes the need for unanimity on last-minute changes to launch rules and replaces them with a &quot;super majority&quot; vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown posted the back grid racing idea in his post-race column on the F1 website on Monday. &quot;Monza is a challenger for the reverse grid sprint race when we consider the best performance this year,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately we can&#39;t continue, but the concept is still something we and the FIA ​​want to work on in the coming months and discuss with the team for next year. Of course, the teams will prepare their cars differently in a sprint race with a rear grille.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Right now, Mercedes has set its car to make the fastest laps and then control the race in front of them. If they know they have to overtake, they have to change that approach.&quot; &quot;We will continue to evaluate new formats to perfect the show, but always maintain the DNA of Formula 1.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If approved, the starting grid for the sprint race will be determined in the reverse order of the championship and the result will determine the starting grid for the main Grand Prix on Sunday.</p>', 'Revive Plan, Sprint Grid', 'Formula 1_1599688199.jpg', '2020-09-10 01:49:59', '2021-08-17 22:08:34');

Then she got up and hugged him for the first time in more than 23 years, a single man. Eisen&#39;s first move outside of this building was the last in a journey they have undertaken together for more than a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After recovering, Moore turned to the phone, recorded the momentous event, and said, &quot;All right, guys. It&#39;s over. It&#39;s over.&quot; The 2020 WNBA season begins on July 25. The Minnesota Lynx is eyeing a fifth title, but for the second year in a row they have done so without one of their star players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011 Moore was selected for the first round for the Lynx. Since then, he has helped them win four championships and was named MVP of the 2014 season. The 31-year-old also has two Olympic gold medals and two World Championship medals. Some would argue that he is the best the WNBA has ever seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2019, she took the sport by surprise by giving up everything for the man she met 12 years ago. A man who has become her brother. Although he was only 16 years old at the time the crime occurred, Irons was tried as an adult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 14, 1997, someone broke into Stanley Stotler&#39;s home on the outskirts of the white working class on St. Louis, Missouri. When Stotler returned, the thief shot him in the head. Stotler survived and was initially unable to identify the perpetrator on the six photos. According to the New York Times, a police officer asked him to make a good guess, and he pointed to a photo of Irons and other photos of African Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, at the preliminary hearing, Stotler identifies Irons as the assailant. But there are no fingerprints linking the teenager to the crime. No traces of DNA or blood. There are no confirmed witnesses.&nbsp;The public defender did not allow Irons to stand up to claim his innocence, saying he was too young and uneducated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prosecutors said Irons admitted to offenses that he and his lawyers have denied. The officer who questioned Irons alone and did not record the interview. During the October 1998 trial, American politicians walked on heavy platforms. The penalties for juvenile offenders are severe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One prosecutor was quoted as saying by Irons: &quot;Don&#39;t be gentle with him because he is young. He is as dangerous as someone five times his age. &quot;We need to send a message to some of these young people that if you act like an old man, you will be treated like an old man.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 1998, at the age of 18, Irons was convicted of assault and theft by a white jury and jailed for 50 years.&nbsp;In 2007, nine years after that decision, 18-year-old Moore went to Missouri to visit his family and meet with Irons through the Prison Department they work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following years he continued to return to Jefferson City, his hometown, to visit Irons. She sent him books by his favorite authors and talked to him on the phone before the big games. Finally he decided to take a break from his basketball career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because he always believed that Eisen was telling the truth. &quot;There is something in the truth that makes you believe this will happen,&quot; said Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He just has to keep believing that if we can understand the truth in front of the right people who want to do the right thing, they will do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2019, as he prepared for the new WNBA season, Moore had to work with Irons and his lawyers to request a retrial. He devoted himself to that matter. About 21 years after Irons was found guilty, prosecutors are still reluctant to admit defeat. They tried to prevent an investigation but failed, and in October 2019, Irons finally admitted his innocence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 9, 2020, the Irons assessment was canceled. Judge Daniel Green described the original case as &quot;very lax and at least indirect&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his ruling, the judge cited fingerprints on the door of Stotler&#39;s house that did not match Stotler&#39;s or Irons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is evidence that another person had committed the crime but was never turned over to the defense team at the 1998 trial. The Irons story is not unique and is based on a very complex system and problem to represent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Netflix &#39;13. The 2016 documentary features statistics that show how disproportionate the number of prisons in the US are in African-American. Perhaps the most eye-opening thing is that while a white man in the country has a one in 17 chance of being behind bars, for a black man it is one in three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But sometimes statistics aren&#39;t enough to make a difference. It takes a real human story. People saw Floyd as a father, a brother, someone who called his mother to death. Just as Floyd&#39;s death sparked a global race, Moore hopes the Irons story can change America&#39;s justice system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s about long-term dehumanization that is consciously expressed through the system in our country,&quot; he said. &quot;The system that was consciously woven into the structure of our homes is still here and has influenced us for generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;George Floyd is human and all other life is human. If you put someone down, you become inhuman.&quot; At the push of a button, you can sign an online petition calling for the release of convicted convicts. But that&#39;s not how Moore works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He doesn&#39;t want every athlete to leave his job and join them. But he also doesn&#39;t care what your social media says. What matters is what people do when no one is watching. Moore battled dehumanization which he spoke of by playing chess with iron. He visited her on holidays. When he was released, he invited Irons over to his home. Your entire philosophy can be reduced to three words: Show yourself again and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you have the power or the resources, leave it and empower others,&quot; he said. Moore believes in sacrificing what he has in order to lift others and become better people. That is selflessness, many of us don&#39;t have the power to have access to. But selflessness may be what the world needs to make real change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the fact that it was so closely tied to a man&#39;s future meant that, even though he did succeed on that occasion, he knew exactly how tough the fight would be. When asked what he learned when he released the Irons, the list is long and the scope of the problems is astonishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should drug laws be changed? Are the police overstated? Are you short on funds? What is better, criminal or restorative justice? How was the voting procedure changed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law enforcement reform is at the heart of the fight between Moore and Irons. But now he knows the importance of criminal justice reform and changes in the US approach to prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s very broad,&quot; said Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I started my apprenticeship, I was just as devastated - as are all of us, the people who have opened our eyes lately.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he&#39;s busy, Moore knows he can&#39;t do everything and he isn&#39;t alone in his struggles. He has inspired other athletes to follow suit. Former University of Connecticut teammates Renee Montgomery and Tiffany Hayes are taking a break from the WNBA this season to help with voter registration and social justice reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, Moore will stick to reforms. Their &quot;Win with Justice&quot; campaign seeks to challenge a &quot;winning&quot; culture that is meant to undermine our community&#39;s trust in those who are responsible for promoting public safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said, &quot;I saw the connection between sport and the leadership that prosecutors have for winning and losing. What is victory and what is defeat?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will continue to try to help and share and enable others to do the same.&quot; It is not yet clear in what form Moore&#39;s work will continue or whether he will return to basketball. The release of Irons, now 40 years old, may be the end of a journey for him and Moore, but it will not be the end of their friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; said Irons when Moore asked him to explain his feelings about the camera recording the moment of his release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shook his head several times before finally muttering &quot;live&quot;. He paused and then continued: &quot;I feel like I can live now. Thanks to everyone who supported me - Maya and her family. I am so grateful that I have a place to go home to.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wiped the tears from his eyes before removing the face masks made for him by other prisoners. These are called &quot;hopes&quot; because that is what they need. This is what Irons and Moore have needed for the past 13 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I won&#39;t forget it,&quot; he said. &quot;And I will help them as much as I can.&quot;</p>', 'Maya Moore, Successful Campaign', 'Maya Moore_1599688847.png', '2020-09-10 02:00:47', '2021-08-16 16:54:07'),

Leaning on the pile of rubble beside his bicycle, he could barely lift a finger, let alone lift a thumb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams motor in order. He didn&#39;t fall, but neither his brain nor his body were working properly. This will &quot;tie in&quot; - the athlete&#39;s term for endurance when the blood sugar in the body is so low that you can barely think clearly and your feet can no longer pedal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was frustrated, helpless, and confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally a car stops and the future US racing champion is saved. From her aunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My dad drove me 70 miles for my first real trip,&quot; explains Williams. &quot;But traveling wasn&#39;t the problem - he didn&#39;t teach me to eat and drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My dad is used to a lot of pain and suffering and he insisted I had to get serious about cycling. The bike is expensive. He told me, &#39;This is not a game and if I want to invest in you you have to be serious. It&#39;s real money.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams Kalman&#39;s father is one of the top cyclists in Belize and a competitor to the Pan American Games. His son became the first US champion for black national criteria and road racing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin Williams proudly wears Stars and Stripes. But the journey that brought him here was far from an American dream. Instead, the story is marked by years of frustration, poor wages and underinvestment. He quit the sport twice before becoming champion. He&#39;s now part of a self-made team that is looking for a different path and trying to make a difference from within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams describes himself as a patriot. He was voiced on social media after George Floyd&#39;s death in May. He felt there were many things that needed to be changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rookie who grew up in southern Los Angeles should watch out for guns, not pits. This is a city where people don&#39;t ride buses, let alone ride bicycles. Here, a long-running love affair with cars means that the 12-lane highway is unlikely to receive temporary treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither of that held Williams down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The best thing about the black community is the feeling of pride when something happens and someone has the opportunity,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People understand when someone does something outside of their circumstances. People realize that it is something. I don&#39;t look like a typical motorcyclist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007 things got serious. Williams turned professional at the age of 17 and joined the Rock Racing criteria team. Over the next five years he gave everything he had on the professional stage. He took her to the Tracks Livestrong development team, to major competitions in the US, Europe and beyond, and gave Williams a young and powerful &quot;culture shock&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s a change that&#39;s too dramatic,&quot; he said. &quot;So I went home and went to college and got a job that made me realize that I never wanted to work for anyone in my life!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After taking the time to find out who he was, Justin instead helped bring his younger brother Corey into the sport and on a team that recognized the siblings&#39; talent and potential. Together, the pair impressed in a critical professional competition with another team, Silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Corey has skills I don&#39;t have,&quot; Justin said. &quot;I wanted to show him that he had support because I was alone. And then our story really started to develop.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criterion races usually involve a series of rounds in one lap in which the opposing team tries to break free and beat their opponent to the final violent blast. It drew a healthy crowd to cities across the United States. The brothers went on to have one of their most successful years in 2016, winning some of the biggest competitions in the country. Corey won eight straight wins, he and Justin teamed up and finished their move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Your relationship with your brother is difficult to imitate two boys with the same chemistry,&quot; said Justin. &quot;But the following year people said the team was too much for us. God forbid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin signed a contract for another year, realizing that Corey would be getting a new contract as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corey&#39;s contract bid never worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I asked Justin to join the team and then I got fired,&quot; said Corey, still looking incredulous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And herein lies the problem for two African-American cyclists. The problem with which black athletes, perhaps unwittingly, prints along the lines of racial prejudice. You face micro attacks which, despite the name, are no less painful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin believes that the individuality of athletes is further thought in the &quot;too European&quot; structure. He believes drivers should not stand up for a team ethic that values ​​compliance and compliance. He and Corey felt like they weren&#39;t one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People in sports don&#39;t want to admit that you have to work ten times harder when you are black,&quot; says Justin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There were times that Corey didn&#39;t get the chance he deserved because they didn&#39;t know him and because he didn&#39;t talk to them and smiled. They called him grumpy or mean and he missed opportunities based on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am very sociable, but it is something that grows out of necessity. It is deeper than being an optimist. Being optimistic is part of my survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you grew up in black America, people looked at you a certain way when you weren&#39;t inviting.&quot; Corey described himself as &quot;more introverted and shy&quot; than his brother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added, &quot;People who know me know that I am a good person and that I do a lot for people I know and love. If people want to think that I am somehow because we don&#39;t know each other, they are not worth it. You try to find out. Tofu. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissatisfied, Justin left the sport for the second time. Corey goes on with other teams for an annual salary of often $ 4,500 before sharing the profits with the six-member team. Not just living a dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the stars and stripes on Justin&#39;s T-shirt is a shiny lion - an allusion to his Rastafarian origins. It represents a new direction which he himself helps to shape. In 2018, he received $ 18,000 from the Specialized&#39;s Rocket Espresso team. With that money, he financed himself around a European racing chain with a fixed chain, acting as an independent chain. After more than a year, he&#39;s made six-figure wins as he takes the sport and earns it for himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fixed gear racing [where the bike has only one gear and is therefore more difficult to ride] really embodies American culture,&quot; Justin said. I thought, &quot;This is how cycling is supposed to be in America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can keep my personal sponsorship, which leads to a better financial situation. And I have the most fun when I&#39;m alone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin wants others in his position to benefit, starting with Corey. &quot;I had the best years I&#39;ve seen in cities like Milan, Barcelona and London, going out with friends, passed out on the floor and enjoying the places I&#39;ve been than just airports, hotels to see. race or get back on the plane. I throw it at his head, &quot;said Justin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Corey found himself in an outdated professional team structure that didn&#39;t allow people to be innovative. He fell and wasn&#39;t allowed to make a name for himself. It just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So I thought, &#39;Let&#39;s just give up and do it ourselves.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Los Angeles L39ion started in 2019. A team dedicated to increasing diversity and promoting inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin said: &quot;We made it clear with a gun that it was more than just a cycling team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You hear how you grew up to be more than just an athlete from LeBron James - that&#39;s what I imagined when I thought about doing it as an athlete. To be able to improve the lives of others and make someone&#39;s life a positive impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We started looking for people we trusted - and there were a lot of them. Alex Garcia, a child I was driving, had to stop driving to help his mother. He had nowhere to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s not just about winning - it&#39;s a combination of everything that makes everything work: accessibility, results, social media, the way we position ourselves. This is how sport grows. You can see yourself in sport, when there are representatives and it will make you want to participate. &quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Legion raised $ 120,000 through mass funding, though that doesn&#39;t even cover all of the driver&#39;s wages for a year&#39;s minimum wage. Then there are car costs, flights, administrative costs. Justin acts as mechanic and manager to keep costs down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team must be tough to make changes. Justin and Corey believe they want to create a California-owned sports franchise, but are also determined to expand across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For me, I want to build my own sport in America - thousands of fans screaming on tracks in downtown,&quot; Justin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Something has to change. If we wait for someone else to change, we&#39;re going to wait forever. I don&#39;t want my career to be frustrated and frustrated because I&#39;m afraid to get out of the box and do something different and new.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, they needed more than a father, more than community support - they needed the entire sport to be occupied and cared for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s all about creating superstars,&quot; said Corey. &quot;And cycling is gone. We want people to fall in love with a hero. A superhero.&quot;</p>', 'Justine, corey williams, los Angeles', 'Justine and core_1599689014.jpg', '2020-09-10 02:03:34', '2021-08-14 01:44:54'),

The striker ran towards him and when his shot was parried by goalkeeper Rune Yarstein, McNair was there to mark the rebound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visitors were back ahead a minute later when the tough Haaland ran to KO Sorlot to unleash a superb left-footed shot from outside the penalty area at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was 3-1 in 19 minutes when left-wing Haitam Aleesami was hit with a volley from the far post by Sorloth and he scored four goals two minutes after the break, created by Haaland selflessly who beat Cathcart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lad from Dortmund showed his class again and didn&#39;t give Peacock-Farrell a chance by turning his left foot in the top corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house bow couldn&#39;t have been worse for Barraclow</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the overall performance in Romania was below average, at least the players showed a desire to get a result with a maximum of 10 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing in an empty Windsor Park will always be difficult for NI, especially given the vocal support they usually get from the crowd, but few thought the team-to-team gap would be as big as it used to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As strong and clinical as Norway, NI felt uneasy for most of the game, allowing physical opponents to outsmart their muscles and outperform them in all areas of the pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baracklow would have been boosted by McNair, who equalized four minutes into Norway&#39;s early opener, but they shut down immediately after the restart to give Halland a chance to deal with his missile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many defenders will be up against the former RB Salzburg man and while Ballard is bravely doing his job, neither he nor Craig Cathcart have been able to stop the tough striker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the fifth goal came in more than half an hour of play it looked the bigger shot, as NI conceded five goals for the first time in an international race after losing to England in 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite some positive results for NI, Captain Davis relishes the fact that he hit NI Pat Jennings&#39; record in his 119th international appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his debut in February 2005, he would have had some tougher nights than in Belfast when he was on the captain&#39;s armband for the 67th time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Jordan Thompson trying to fall deeper to get the ball behind four, Davis, 35, played a little further than the previous game but could not prevent his team from being beaten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Davis reached the personal stage, his old partner Johnny Evans disappeared from the list again after not traveling to Romania for personal reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His club, Leicester City, sent him a lucky note for Monday night&#39;s game, but he did not rejoin.

But hitting the ball &quot;in a dangerous or reckless manner in court or for neglecting the consequences&quot; - to quote the rules - has no reason to be pardoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, procrastination will have far more serious consequences for sport and will leave the smell of preferential treatment for the rich and influential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The action was not intended. Djokovic doesn&#39;t see where the loose ball is going, but that&#39;s part of the problem. In recent years, more than a few times, he failed to pay attention to the well-being of others in his quest for obvious success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 French Open quarter-final against Tomas Berdych, Djokovic nearly hit the linesman after slipping from his hand after a heavy blow. And later that year, in a match against Dominic Thiem in the ATP final, he fired the ball at his coaching staff, who were seated directly in front of the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s not a problem for me.

He said he &quot;had to take these lessons for my growth and development as a player and as a person&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Djokovic says it a lot, but we hope he does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A perfect year on the pitch - Djokovic won all 26 of his matches before his unfortunate clash with Pablo Careno Busta - was a far cry from sailing anywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 17-time Grand Slam winner is the driving force behind the Adria Tour: a series of show matches in the Serbian capital Belgrade and in the Croatian city of Zadar. Djokovic is one of four players who contracted Covid-19 when social distancing was abandoned - on tennis courts, during friendly football and basketball games, and at nightclubs that host weekend parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We do it with a pure heart and with sincere intentions,&quot; Djokovic said in another apology on Instagram. But it was rated very poorly and did not help tennis&#39;s efforts to return to professional play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the formation of the Professional Tennis Players Association, Djokovic also revealed more than just a few feathers. He had considerable support among his peers and had been debated for a long time, but the weather seemed wrong again. The opening meeting takes place on the eve of the US Open at Flushing Meadows, which offers 91% of the usual prize pool while missing out on the income of some 850,000 hungry and thirsty ticket holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only Djokovic can tell whether attention has been focused on the new association and whether public opposition from Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer contributed to Sunday&#39;s event in New York. But he angrily fired the ball at the game billboard before being disqualified. He had just wasted three breakpoints, but instead he did well and didn&#39;t seem to be heading into a stressful afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 33-year-old knows he has a golden opportunity to win his 18th Grand Slam this week and his next opportunity - the French Open at Roland Garros - will not be facilitated by the presence of 12-times champion Nadal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Djokovic has repeatedly overcome difficulties in the past.

Let&#39;s face it, Leeds are the first of many clubs to spend money on success and not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see it today - clubs pay ridiculous salaries and transfer fees to get into the golden zone known as the Premier League.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Leeds were at the end of the table when we bought him, but I was the chairman who let him go. It will never be forgotten.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Leeds midfielder Phillips won his call-up to England</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10 defining moments for a doctorate under Bielsa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That summer, Krasner was the public face of efforts to keep Wigan Athletic on hold after the Latics were released by the Hong Kong-based owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16 years ago, Krasner was an accountant who built an impressive reputation as a bankruptcy administrator by advising companies that could not pay their debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly he was also a Leeds fan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial shift at Elland Road, started under Peter Ridsdale&#39;s leadership, was started by Professor John Mackenzie. At the start of 2004, Leeds were in a state of desperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For 30 years in my business life, I have been telling people what they did wrong,&quot; said Krasner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I thought it was time to show people I could do it. I was never afraid to close the door, so I did the job when no one else wanted.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krasner assembles a consortium of local business people to save the club. Others, including former Bradford City owner Jeffrey Richmond, were also involved, but Krasner is a public figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was an interesting experience, especially on Thursday night when the News of the World called you hoping you were drunk to get some news,&quot; said Krasner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Bielsa now given the hero status that brought Leeds back to the Premier League, Eddie Gray, the man who beat them remains a legendary figure at the club, and fans believe the Scotsman has been placed in an impossible position. when asked to take over the managerial position in November 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turned out that Gray, who will be commenting on LUTV at Anfield, won 2-1 over Manchester City in Krasner&#39;s first game as chairman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But behind the scenes, Krasner was wrestling with some big problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Over &pound; 100 million in debt which doesn&#39;t sound like much at the moment - a central striker. That was huge in 2004,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trevor Birch runs the club. He knows me professionally because I taught him in the 1990s. He tells me what and for whom to thank. We had to put &pound; 20 million into our attorney&#39;s account. We found him - we pawned my son to the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For six weeks I finished work at 5:00 p.m. and from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. we went to the law firm. They had night shifts for me. We had to sign 113 contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People say, &#39;Do you like him?&#39; &quot;I don&#39;t even like him. Don&#39;t buy a soccer club if you&#39;re under stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You sit there and look at an entry gate and you are a million feet ahead, one against you and you are a million pounds less. There are professional companies that do nasty things in the name of money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I sold the stadium and training ground, but I did it so they both could be bought back. The stadium was already there. We obviously sold a lot of players. A year later the debt was &pound; 24 million which is still ongoing. A lot.&quot; A lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was so much gunfire. At first, every day when I came home, I thought,&quot; Here&#39;s another one we survived. &quot;In the end it happened week after week, but money was always pressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are making arrangements with everyone to reduce debt. I spoke with Inland Revenue and asked them to give me three years to sort out &pound; 10 million. When we sold the club, we lowered it to 3 million.&quot; Lose weight. I don&#39;t think they think so. &quot;It will take three months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krasner was sold to former Chelsea owner Ken Bates in 2005. After their relationship collapsed, he quit the club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krasner remains a fan and a source of bitter sadness as Norman Hunter, Jack Charlton and Trevor Cherry, three of Leeds&#39; legendary players - the first two he personally knew - were not present to see their old club revive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He recognizes his place in the Leeds United journey but knows it is time for others to enjoy the limelight, hopefully with far less stress than he has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The problem is you don&#39;t have a football club,&quot; said Krasner. &quot;You may be in law, but really you are just a guardian for the next generation.&quot;</p>', 'Leeds, Premier league', 'Gerald_1599689795.jpg', '2020-09-10 02:16:35', '2021-08-16 11:39:01'),

It was additionally the first occasion when that Michael, the north London-conceived child of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur and an English artist, permitted his own bliss to encroach on his vaulting proficient aspiration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of shaping the overflowing team Wham! in 1981, he and school companion Andrew Ridgeley scored a line of worldwide hits that made them pin-ups and even pioneers: in 1985, Wham! left a mark on the world by turning into the primary Western gathering to visit China. After a year, Michael vigilantly called time on the two-piece before their bubbly pop sweets like Club Tropicana and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go could become antiquated &ndash; Wham! bowed out in the best style comprehensible, with a rat show at London&#39;s Wembley Stadium. In 1987, he delivered his introduction solo collection Faith &ndash; an assortment of cutting edge pop-R&amp;B which sold in excess of 25 million duplicates around the world, setting him up there with Madonna, Michael Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston as a symbol of the period. Close by the music, he refined his pin-up status with a picture that Paul Flynn, creator of Good As You: 30 Years of Gay Britain, calls &quot;straight drag&quot;. Flynn says that in 1987&#39;s Faith video, Michael &quot;dressed himself up particularly like Tom Cruise in Top Gun&quot;, a style determined to be as attractive as could be expected under the circumstances. Or on the other hand, as Michael put it himself, intentionally, on Freedom! &#39;90, after his band Wham! finished in 1986 and he started zeroing in on his performance vocation, he &quot;returned home [and] got a spic and span face for the young men at MTV&quot; .&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection is a great apologia for being in the storeroom &ndash; and the one where he walks out on distinction &ndash; Paul Flynn&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, it&#39;s unthinkable not to see Michael&#39;s Faith picture &ndash; and his assurance to shed it with Listen without Prejudice Vol 1 &ndash; through the crystal of his own stifled sexuality. By the last part of the 1980s he realized he was unquestionably more pulled in to men than ladies, however decided to keep it covered up for his family and vocation. &quot;On the off chance that you will probably turn into the greatest selling craftsman in America &ndash; which was as yet my odd objective &ndash; you&#39;re not going to make life hard for yourself, are you?&quot; he revealed to Gay Times in 2007. Michael didn&#39;t come out until 1998 when he was captured by a covert official for participating in an &quot;obscene demonstration&quot; in a LA open toilet &ndash; an episode he at that point sent up in that year&#39;s disco banger Outside, alleviating any shame he may have felt. &quot;I&#39;d administration the network,&quot; he sang with his tongue solidly in his cheek, &quot;yet I as of now have, you see.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his first independent collection Faith, Michael received a performatively macho picture total with pilots and calfskin coat (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his first independent collection Faith, Michael embraced a performatively macho picture total with pilots and calfskin coat (Credit: Getty Images)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the event that Outside appeared to show fans another, more freed Michael, at that point it was a cycle that began eight years sooner with Listen without Prejudice Vol 1. Flynn calls the collection Michael&#39;s &quot;great apologia for being in the wardrobe&quot; just as &quot;the collection where he walks out on popularity&quot;. &quot;It&#39;s where he understands where his empty aspirations have driven him to, and the trade offs they have included, which have such a great amount to do with his sexuality,&quot; Flynn says. He calls attention to that the piercing collection track Mother&#39;s Pride, on which Michael sings about a child heading out to war, can be perused as an analogy for a child exposing the unadulterated truth. Absolutely, Michael conveys verses, for example, &quot;and in her heart the opportunity has arrived to lose a child&quot; with obvious tenderness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retribution with his sexuality&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While composing Faith, Michael masked any close to home unrest inside conspicuous popular music that was intended to get the zeitgeist &ndash; however the music video for I Want Your Sex, the collection&#39;s reluctantly provocative lead single, included his then-sweetheart Cathy Jeung, Michael later said it was expounded on a man who was putting on a show. On Listen without Prejudice Vol 1, nonetheless, Michael&#39;s intricate private life fuelled music that was more repressed and nuanced, and which insinuated his sexuality without making anything unequivocal. Cowhands and Angels, a delightful jazz-seasoned song from the collection, was enlivened by a similar solitary love that Michael dug for I Want Your Sex. &quot;He was the person I was enamored with when I was with Cathy (Jeung), who was certainly infatuated with me around then,&quot; he revealed to Attitude magazine in 2004. &quot;So it was exceptionally personal.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were likewise traces of Michael&#39;s internal clash in Heal the Pain, a Beatles-affected society pop melody which he later recorded as a two part harmony with Paul McCartney. Presently, when Michael sings, &quot;By what means can the rest of the world be a spot that your heart can grasp? Regard yourself since no one else has the ability to satisfy you,&quot; it&#39;s anything but difficult to hear him coordinating this sound exhortation at himself. Somewhere else, the house-spotted Soul Free &ndash; other than Freedom! &#39;90, the collection&#39;s just uptempo melody &ndash; sparkled with the chance of a semi-illegal rush as Michael sang in an overjoyed falsetto: &quot;When you contact me infant, I don&#39;t have no way out, goodness that sweet enticement in your voice!&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opportunity! &#39;90 is tied in with breaking free of your past &ndash; and for Michael this is by all accounts as much about creation a highlight his record mark as about grasping his sexuality &ndash; Leo Kalyan&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding, it is reductive to propose that Listen without Prejudice Vol 1 was exclusively about Michael preparing his sexuality. It&#39;s likewise a collection where he shook off any leftovers of his high schooler pop years. &quot;Opportunity! 90 is tied in with breaking free of your past,&quot; Kalyan says, &quot;and for George Michael this is by all accounts as much about creation a highlight his record mark as about grasping his sexuality just because&quot;. The wonderful, slow-copying Waiting for That Day set Michael close to the huge young men of British stone by obtaining from The Rolling Stones &ndash; Mick Jagger and Keith Richards get a co-composing acknowledgment for his gesture to You Can&#39;t Always Get What You Want &ndash; and Praying for Time, a socially cognizant number, has earned correlations with John Lennon throughout the long term. Delivered as the collection&#39;s lead single, it discovered Michael wrestling with Western riches imbalance and the deception encompassing it. Indeed, even 30 years on, his dry perception that &quot;good cause is a coat you wear two times every year&quot; despite everything feels stingingly on the button.</p>', 'George Michael', 'p08qvzz5 (1)_1599770655.webp', '2020-09-11 00:44:15', '2021-08-12 21:02:43'),

The coronavirus closures and the resulting record-breaking economic downturn have closed restaurants and shops and halted travel, forcing companies to downsize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A government spokesman said he had protected 9.6 million jobs on a retention system and paid billions in loans and grants to thousands of companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We continue to support livelihoods and income through our work plans to ensure nothing is left without hope or opportunity. This includes a &pound; 1,000 retention bonus for companies that can get employees back to work.&quot; , he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With our Kickstart program, we also created new roles for youth, created incentives for apprenticeship training and training, and supported and protected jobs in the tourism and hospitality sector through VAT cuts and last month&#39;s Eat Out to Help Out program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boots, John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, owner of Zizzi Azzurri, and furniture retailer DFS were among the household names announcing layoff plans for July. A survey found that every third company expects to lay off some employees between July and September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are my rights if I am released?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is the unemployment rate nearing a 40 year low?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s new in the release schema?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies planning 20 or more layoffs within a &quot;company&quot; must by law notify the government via a form called HR1 which states how many jobs they wish to lose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the number of companies submitting reports and the number of risk positions indicate at an early stage that a large number of jobs are likely to be created in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grant scheme, under which the government temporarily pays workers&#39; salaries, expired in October, raising fears that employers will have to cut more jobs by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The reason this data is so useful is because there was a delay in presenting all other official data,&quot; said Nay Comineti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This puts policymakers in a very challenging position. A huge government support program is coming to an end, but on official data we still don&#39;t know how big the jobs crisis is or where we are going when we enter the fall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that the data, along with other company surveys and projections, show &quot;a rather bleak and consistent picture for the next few months&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers planning fewer than 20 layoffs are not required to file notifications, so the number of planned layoffs will be higher than these figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official employment statistics, which are usually months behind what happens on the ground, still do not show a sharp increase in unemployment or layoffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the government&#39;s Bureau of Budget Responsibility estimates that in the worst case scenario, unemployment could hit four million in the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Northern Irish businesses submitted form HR1 to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and are not included in these figures.</p>', 'Redundancies planned, coronavirus', 'redundancies_1599813440.jpg', '2020-09-11 12:37:20', '2021-08-11 23:58:35'),

Norman denied all charges against him in a statement to BuzzFeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While DeGeneres has not publicly considered allegations of misconduct in his broadcast, he did respond to allegations of racism and toxicity in a July 30 letter to his CBS News staff. In the letter, DeGeneres said he hoped the show would be a &quot;place of happiness&quot; where everyone was &quot;treated with respect&quot; and &quot;disappointed to learn&quot; that it was &quot;not&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeGeneres said in his July letter, &quot;My name is on the show and everything we do, and I am responsible for it ... As we grow exponentially, I can&#39;t control everything and depend on other people to do their job.&quot; because they know that I want to end it.

Cinema-goers rated the thriller, starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicky &quot;B&quot; CinemaScore, the lowest rating for Nolan&#39;s 2006 edition of The Prestige.

That means a lot to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tenet discharge is also discussed in terms of the health risks associated with indoor gatherings. Several prominent film critics have stated that they will not review Tenet for ethical reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the theater chain is struggling to stay fluid. Exhibitors say they need a new film to survive. Last weekend was the first significant opportunity for US cinemas to draw back audiences.

To be too brave and not really listen, or I would be criticized for being too positive and polite and not seeing problems. Lots of things. And, you know, there&#39;s always a grain of truth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his book, Hastings tells what he said about him in one of those sessions - that he was too aggressive, arrogant, and scoffed when other people had ideas.

And I&#39;m just tired. Anyway, I&#39;m not sure I think he&#39;s right. But his sense of clarity about it is amazing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hastings is leading Netflix through four major changes - from renting DVDs, streaming other people&#39;s shows, producing your own shows, to moving globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Netflix received more Oscar and Emmy nominations than any other studio, and this is thanks in large part to Sarandos. &quot;My job is to select everything on Netflix,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year it selected nearly 400 shows and each - be it &quot;The Crown&quot; or its royal cousin &quot;Tiger King&quot; - started on the pitch. &quot;We probably listen to about 100 every day. So these are films and series, television, global and documentaries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first sound Sarandos heard and the first show Netflix produced in 2013 was House of Cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stahl asked, &quot;Tell us why you wanted the Cardboard House in the first place.&quot; What do you see there &quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s Shakespeare,&quot; said Sarandos. &quot;It&#39;s about greed, power and sex - all good television quality.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright star in House of Cards.

That combination can do it all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How big is a checkbook? Well, Sarandos paid $ 100 million for the first two seasons of House of Cards. Netflix has been known to buy its way - as booed by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where Netflix executives literally dump money on future show producers:<br />\r\nSarando&#39;s budget for content spent on programming last year was $ 15 billion. &quot;Yes. But not that many in the world,&quot; said Hastings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But you paid some stars 30 million, 40 million bucks? The pressure on other studios to agree on what you did was enormous. How much will Smith get today? Forty million? Fifty million?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you what Will Smith did,&quot; Sarandos laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variety has announced that Netflix will likely pay Will Smith $ 35 million to star in the sequel to the Netflix film &quot;Bright&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This summer, Netflix transferred $ 100 million of its assets to a black-owned bank, and Hastings and his wife donated $ 120 million of their own money to historic black colleges and universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hastings, valued at $ 5 billion, has pledged to donate most of his fortune to charity.<br />\r\nStahl asked Hastings, &quot;So Ted is your content manager, then you make him co-CEO.

This includes, according to the company, false accusations of electoral fraud or electoral fraud or ballot results, including claiming victory before results are confirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The policy will take effect on September 17, a few weeks before the November 3 presidential election. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans are expected to vote for the first time by letter in this election, and many are relying on search engines and social media to find out how to do this.

However, it is unclear whether their efforts will be enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday, Google announced it would tighten its search guidelines in connection with elections, in particular by removing the auto-settlement function of claims against or against political candidates or in connection with the voting process. This means that searches such as &quot;prize to candidate&quot; or claims such as &quot;You can vote by phone&quot; won&#39;t be completed automatically, the company said. Last year the company banned political advertising.<br />\r\nLast week, Facebook said it would limit new political advertising in the week leading up to the election and remove posts spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and the vote.

Each country is responsible for its own election process, Krebs said, which makes it difficult for hackers to interfere with the national vote. Although tallying votes manually on paper can take some time, even though the tabulation process went wrong in some areas, paper grading helps reviewers verify accurate results.<br />\r\n&quot;If you find abnormalities or something unusual, you want to be able to retrieve the tape,&quot; Krebs told CNET. &quot;And if you have paper, you have receipts.

Unlike other platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which primarily focus on the people you follow, TikTok&#39;s main &quot;Pages For You&quot; feed offers users viral content regardless of whether they follow the account they are on. position, which is very influential. It is difficult to avoid unwanted footage.<br />\r\nGiven TikTok&#39;s youth user base, graphic content can easily reach large numbers of children and teens. While TikTok serves to erase all copies of the video, users warn others to slide when they see a gruff image of a man with a long beard sitting at a table.<br />\r\nSome users also warned users that the video would appear buried in another video that seemed harmless. Many say the safest option is to stay completely out of the app until TikTok fixes the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TikTok already has measures in place to limit content related to self-harm. Searching for &quot;suicide,&quot; &quot;suicide video&quot; and other related terms gave no results.

Community standards don&#39;t take into account homophobia and violence and how these overlap. He sees them all as separate things that need to be protected,&quot; Wiesinger said. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So used to and depend on it. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence tools that automate the moderation process and enforce community standards on websites don&#39;t recognize the intent or origin of the people who post them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Wassinger said, &quot;I was told about the use of lynch images. ... I was told about violent content when I presented images of racism and transphobia.&quot;<br />\r\nAccording to a recent report on platform transparency, from April to June 2020, nearly 95% of comments flagged as hate speech on Facebook were discovered by AI. and on YouTube, 99.2% of comments removed for violating community standards were tagged by AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That means you apply these community standards and these bots only look for certain things. They are automatic. They can&#39;t make decisions about them,&quot; Wysinger said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prejudice can be built into algorithms by the programmer who designed them, even if not intentional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the technology is made up of a homogeneous group, mostly white and Asian men. So what happens is the opinion, the experience that goes into making this decision, reflects on the majority group. And so are people with different backgrounds - black people. . &quot; &quot;Different religions, conservatives, liberals - they don&#39;t have a definite picture if the company is more diverse,&quot; said Mark Lucky, a digital strategist who has previously worked at Twitter, Reddit and Facebook.<br />\r\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, said he believed the platform &quot;should be as expressive as possible&quot; and that social media companies &quot;shouldn&#39;t be brokering the truth about everything people say online&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a recent study by the Pew Research Center found that nearly three-quarters of adults in the United States believe that social media sites deliberately censor political views. In the past two years, two hearings in Congress have discussed technology censorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We hear that there is anti-conservative prejudice from Facebook or other platforms because conservatives keep repeating this,&quot; said Susan Benesh, executive director of the Dangerous Speech Project, a Washington-based organization that has advised Facebook, Twitter, Google and others. . Internet companies are ways to reduce harmful content online while protecting freedom of expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he added, &quot;I would be surprised if this was partly due to the fact that the most popular and most visited groups on Facebook and Facebook Pages are very conservative on an almost daily basis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also finds it interesting that &quot;many conservatives or ultra-conservatives complain that platforms are biased, while Black Lives Matter activists believe that the platforms download their content disproportionately&quot;.<br />\r\nA 2019 review of more than 400 political Facebook pages by left-wing media analyst Media Matters found conservative pages fared the same as liberal pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, reliable data on this issue is scarce, and social media platforms are largely unsure of how to make decisions about how to moderate content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid persistent criticism, Facebook has commissioned an independent review, led by former Republican Senator John Kiel, to investigate allegations of anti-conservative bias. The 2019 Kyl report contains detailed recommendations for improving transparency. Facebook agreed to form a board of directors to make decisions about content removal. Facebook said it would &quot;further research our future policies and practices and adapt them if necessary&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fernandez said the focus should be on obliging technology companies to publicly disclose their moderation rules and tactics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benes points out, &quot;We have almost no control over downloads, so moderating content is actually more complicated than simply downloading or releasing content.&quot; from technology companies to enable process assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Protecting freedom of expression while keeping people safe is a challenge that needs to be continuously improved and refined.

The stand-alone test is about the size of a credit card and is based on the same technology used to test for flu, sore throat and other infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the newest, cheaper and simpler test available in the US market. This opens up new opportunities for expanding testing as schools and businesses struggle to reopen and flu season approaches. The FDA also recently highlighted a Yale University saliva test that passed multiple supplies causing congestion tests.<br />\r\nBoth tests have limitations and cannot be done at home. Several companies are developing rapid in-house tests, but not yet. Abbott&#39;s new test, like most older coronavirus tests, still requires a nasal swab from a health care professional. The saliva test at Yale eliminates the need for tampons, but can only be done in a high-quality laboratory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, rapid tests like Abbott&#39;s are less accurate than tests developed in the laboratory. The FDA said in a statement announcing the decision that in some cases Abbott&#39;s negative test results may need to be confirmed by laboratory tests. The agency issued emergency clearance for patients suspected of having COVID-19 in Abbott&#39;s tests late Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these supplements are designed to help increase the number of tests available. About 690,000 people are currently tested every day in the US, up from 850,000 daily tests late last month. Many public health experts believe that the country should test significantly more people soon to identify those infected, isolate them and contain the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FDA notes that the Abbott test can be used in a doctor&#39;s office, emergency room, or in some schools. &quot;Given the simplicity of this test, it is likely that this test will be widely available,&quot; said the FDA.<br />\r\nNasal swabs sent to the laboratory have been the standard for screening for COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Although the tests are considered to be very accurate, they are based on expensive specialty machines and chemicals. This shortage of supply has resulted in repeated delays in reporting, especially during last month&#39;s spike in cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governments and health professionals view rapid testing that can be carried out outside the laboratory system as key to increasing capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This screening test is what we need in schools, in the workplace and in nursing homes to catch asymptomatic transmitters,&quot; said Dr. Jonathan Quick of the Rockefeller Foundation in an interview earlier this month. The non-profit group is urging the United States to run about 4 million tests a day through October, mostly rapid tests.<br />\r\nThe fourth rapid test for COVID-19<br />\r\nAbbott&#39;s BinaxNOW is the fourth rapid test to detect the COVID-19 antigen, a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, not the virus itself. This is considered a faster, if sometimes less accurate, screening method. Other tests have to be performed on a small machine.<br />\r\nInside the Abbott test is a special layered strip that interacts with the COVID-19 antigen. The patient&#39;s nose swab is inserted into the card and a few drops of chemical solution are added. The marker on the card indicates whether the test is positive or negative - similar to a pregnancy test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other antigen test manufacturers, Quidel and Becton Dickinson, said they were not meeting the demand for such tests. The third, LumiraDx, plans to begin testing for its recently approved antigen later this month. Abbott expects labor tests to begin in September and reach 50 million tests per month by October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inclusion of antigen testing will go a long way in meeting the Trump administration&#39;s estimate that 90 million tests for COVID-19 will be available per month by September if needed. But US Test King Admiral Brett Giroar stressed that the US can control the outbreak with far fewer tests.<br />\r\n&quot;We don&#39;t need a lot of tests&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;It&#39;s capacity ... we don&#39;t need a lot of tests to open it safely and sensibly,&quot; Giroar told reporters recently in a conversation. He identified several key indicators of decline, including new infections and hospitalizations, although testing has slowed down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, the FDA approved a test based on Yale&#39;s saliva that is believed to reduce time and cost compared to similar tests. This is the fifth COVID-19 saliva test approved by regulators. All of them require laboratory processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SalivaDirect was developed by the Yale School of Public Health and can collect samples with any sterile container instead of the special tube required for previous testing. This requires less chemicals. External experts welcomed the new approach but noted its limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is not a rapid test, this is a laboratory test that still has a long delay like other tests,&quot; said Dr. Michael Mina from Harvard University.</p>', 'FDA Approved, Corona Test', 'FDA Approval_1599903044.jpg', '2020-09-12 13:30:44', '2021-08-12 00:01:01'),

The game was removed after Epic Games enabled a feature that allowed users to make in-game purchases for virtual weapons or other items directly from Epic rather than through Apple&#39;s payment system.

Our decision in 2017 to disclose the incident was not only correct, but also embodies the principles we use in conducting our day-to-day operations. these: transparency, integrity, and accountability. &quot;<br />\r\nThe complaint also alleges that Sullivan misled the company after discovering the breach by not divulging important details about the hack. In producing a brief on the new CEO, Sullivan claimed to have edited a draft of his team to remove details about what the hackers were stealing and falsely stated that hackers were only paid after they were identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sullivan was ultimately fired, the complaint said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two hackers responsible for the breach pleaded guilty on October 30, 2019.

Starting as middle age old stories, the story enlivened a Goethe stanza, Der Rattenf&auml;nger; a Grimm Brothers&#39; legend, The Children of Hamelin; and one of Robert Browning&#39;s most popular sonnets, The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Furthermore, albeit every author fiddled with the story, the essentials continued as before: the Piper was employed by Hamelin to free the town of its plague of rodents. Following after the mesmerizing notes of the rodent catcher&#39;s supernatural woodwind, the rodents amiably recorded through the city entryways to their assumed fate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They weren&#39;t the main ones baited by his music, however. At the point when the town wouldn&#39;t recognize the cold hard reality for his administration, the deliverer transformed into a more sinister enticer and desired Hamelin&#39;s youngsters. Enchanted by the notes of his woodwind, the mesmerized young men and young ladies followed the Piper away and basically disappeared.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the story has suffered, so has Hamelin itself, which despite everything looks like it has a place in a fantasy. Boyer&#39;s visit drives guests past columns of half-wooded houses.

In some way or another, the story stirs a base dread, with the Piper a variant of a widespread intruder man that keeps on frequenting us. Guardians wherever still dread the loss of their children. Kids, springing up on the evening news, despite everything disappear each day. And afterward we as a whole eventually disappear in something like a moment. The Piper, at long last, is one soul harvester.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, if the story brings out an all inclusive dread, it despite everything resounds most firmly in Hamelin &ndash; and the Piper&#39;s visit recommends why.

Also, the fifteenth Century Luneburg composition, an early German record of the occasion, alongside five verifiable memory sections, some in Latin and others in Middle Low German, all allude to a comparable story of 130 youngsters or youngsters evaporating on the 26 June 1284, after a pied flautist to a spot called Calvary or Koppen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pied Piper at that point, in excess of a fantasy, turns into the insignia of a significant authentic secret.

The hypothesis is likewise strengthened by proof that the area, recently freed from the Danes, was ready for German colonization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More whimsical hypotheses flourish, as well.

Known as St Vitus&#39; Dance, the moving sickness is archived surfacing in mainland Europe as right on time as the eleventh Century. A type of widespread panic, the move could spread from people to huge gatherings, all determined by an unshakeable impulse to move hotly, now and again for a considerable length of time, frequently jumping and singing and at times daydreaming to the point of weariness and incidentally passing, similar to a top that can&#39;t quit turning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, truth be told, one thirteenth Century flare-up &ndash; an exacting type of move fever &ndash; happened south of Hamelin, in the town of Erfurt, where a gathering of young people were recorded as uncontrollably rotating as they went away, winding up 20km away in a neighboring town. A portion of the kids, one account proposes, lapsed presently, having level out moved themselves to death, and the individuals who endure were left with constant quakes. Maybe, some speculate, Hamelin saw a comparable plague, moving to the non-literal tune of the Piper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, every one of these hypotheses disregard one explicit key to the Hamelin secret. &quot;They don&#39;t clarify the extremely specific date refered to for the loss of the kids, and the nearby feeling of injury,&quot; Reimer noted. &quot;Accomplished something happen that authorities had been concealing?

At the Black Panther dispatch public interview, Marvel maker Kevin Feige said that Chadwick Boseman was their unrivaled decision for the job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After it was declared that Black Panther was to be shot and Boseman freely recognized him, Carter declined interviews.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m clearly not liable for Chad and Black Panther,&quot; he says. &quot;Chad did it.

A genuine annoyance was joined by an unusual sensation in her ear, similar to a parcel of crisps being squashed in somebody&#39;s grasp. Her hands went blue and she needed to hurry to a warm tap to attempt to bring the blood once again into them. The specialist later inquired as to whether she had snapped a photo, yet it had been the keep going thing at the forefront of her thoughts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I continued calling about new manifestations and I would be asked, &#39;How&#39;s your psychological well-being doing?&#39;&quot; she says. &quot;The suggestion being that these indications weren&#39;t treatable or weren&#39;t genuine torment.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She got weird rashes everywhere on over her body or her toes would go splendid red, at times she would wake up with agonizing feelings in various pieces of her middle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One night, as she was conversing with her companion on the telephone she felt the correct side of her face drop. She went directly to the mirror however her face looked ordinary. She was concerned she was having a stroke however the specialists found no proof of one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&#39;s had odd sensations everywhere on over her body as well. At times it seems like somebody is getting her leg with their hands or hairs are being hauled over her face - even inside her mouth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She invested a great deal of energy attempting to disclose what was occurring to specialists. Frequently she just had a five or 10-minute bring in which to attempt to hand-off all that was going on in her body and it wasn&#39;t sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On the off chance that they&#39;d said to me, &#39;Look, you have Covid, and we have no clue about how to treat this,&#39; at that point that&#39;d be fine,&quot; she says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She wriggles as she attempts to sum up how she was dealt with. She&#39;s hesitant to censure staff of the NHS, huge numbers of whom have given her phenomenal consideration yet she says the framework isn&#39;t working for individuals in her position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was nine weeks before Monique could get a test for Covid.

Monique attempted to clarify, she wasn&#39;t apprehensive about getting contaminated, she feared passing the infection on. Wiped out individuals should remain at home, the mother advised her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She trusts that her journal will help individuals to comprehend that it&#39;s not generally that straightforward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While companions made a special effort to support her, Monique could tell that others were getting tired. None of what was befalling her appeared well and good to anybody. &quot;One individual said I was getting fixated on having Covid,&quot; she says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At long last the UK government opened up testing to anybody demonstrating indications. She was excited however there was a trick - the main community she could discover was a drive-in and she didn&#39;t have a vehicle. &quot;A large portion of my companions can&#39;t drive,&quot; she says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One companion stepped up and give her a lift, and the way that he put himself in danger in the process isn&#39;t lost on her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the testing place she expected to be consoled by medical attendants and specialists yet rather it was staffed by fighters, their khakis doused on a sweat-soaked day in June. As she stuck a q-tip up her nose it struck her how youthful they were.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcomes returned negative - demonstrating that she no longer had the infection, however not that she had never had it. It was a gigantic help since she&#39;d been told this implied she was unable to contaminate her loved ones. Be that as it may, she felt odd. &quot;The sentiment of being infectious is mentally difficult to proceed onward from,&quot; she wrote in her journal later. It was likewise befuddling on the grounds that she wasn&#39;t feeling any better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four months after she previously became ill, she chose to move out of her home offer in East London.

It features dramatic shots of South Dakota landscapes such as Mount Rushmore and Badlands National Park, and ends with a presentation by the governor and a visit to South Dakota.<br />\r\nThe state counted 124 infections among people who participated in the Sturgis motorcycle race in August, but does not publish a ranking of infections related to the secondary rally. Health officials in 12 states found more than 300 people with the infection attended the rally, including a Minnesota man who died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokesman Noem Ian Fury defended the use of federal funding for the coronavirus for promotional purposes, saying the state &quot;must definitely encourage tourism&quot; because it is so important to South Dakota&#39;s economy. After agriculture, it is the country&#39;s biggest industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s how people put food on the table,&quot; he said.<br />\r\nThe money for advertising will come from the $ 1.25 billion that the federal government has received to deal with the coronavirus crisis. The US Treasury Department allows states to advertise the money as tourism continues and keeps visitors safe. The Department of Tourism is considering advertising on networks such as History, TBS, USA, Hallmark, A&amp;E and Discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fury said the job in an ad promoting the country as a &quot;safe research post&quot; was in line with a Treasury Department request that the money be used to fight the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Senator Reynold Nesiba, a Democrat from Suu Falls who is a member of the Budget Committee, criticized the decision, saying it was Noah who was raising his political profile rather than helping the country. He argues that the governor&#39;s office has emphasized a cautious approach to using federal funds and has delayed its use for non-profit organizations, universities and companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The way to push our economy back is by facing a pandemic,&quot; said Nesiba.<br />\r\nNoem&#39;s approach is to use a pandemic control approach to attract businesses and tourists to the country. He said he was focused on the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, not the number of infections. That&#39;s 68 people on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Celebrate what makes America great,&quot; he said in the ad. &quot;And experience an amazing place and face in South Dakota.&quot;</p>', 'South Dakota, Governor funds', 'South Dakota_1599914435.jpg', '2020-09-12 16:40:35', '2021-08-14 06:30:15'),

The CDC has been monitoring the outbreak of multisystem inflammatory disease in children (MIS-C), also known as PMIS or sometimes also known as PMIS, since mid-May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC describes it as a &quot;rare but serious illness related to COVID-19&quot; that sometimes occurs after contracting the disease COVID-19 or after coming into contact with someone who has COVID-19. Instead of attacking the lungs as a new coronavirus disease in adults, this syndrome, although very rare, can cause serious, even fatal, heart complications in children.<br />\r\nAs of September 3, the CDC has compiled reports of 792 confirmed cases of MIS-C and 16 deaths in 42 states, New York and Washington, DC. Another case is being investigated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CDC data show that &quot;most cases occur in children between the ages of 1 and 14 years, with a mean age of 8 years&quot;.

But if the numbers were lower, at some point the disease would stop spreading because not enough new people were infected to keep it going. Governments everywhere want to reduce the number of reproductions from about three (the number R if we don&#39;t take action) to less than one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the UK R number?<br />\r\nThe dial number is not specified. Rather, it changes with changes in our behavior or with the development of immunity. Mathematical modellers from Imperial College London are trying to track the changes in numbers when isolation, social distancing and total lockdown occur in the spring. Before any action was taken, they were more than one in number, and conditions were ripe for a major outbreak. Successive restrictions remove it, but only after the full block is pressed below one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Friday 11 September, the government announced that the UK R-number is expected to be 1.0 to 1.2.<br />\r\nAre there regional differences?<br />\r\nScotland has the highest R number - between 1.1 and 1.5. In Wales it ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 and in Northern Ireland from 0.3 to 1.4. In the UK, the highest forecast coefficient R is in London and the Northwest - with a range between 1.1 and 1.3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 1.6 million people have to be barred from mingling outside their homes in the Birmingham area - due to a spike in cases. But the Midlands as a whole actually has the lowest percentage in the UK, from 0.9 to 1.1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does R mean by tightening or loosening the lock?<br />\r\nIn the past, the British government has stated that the number R is one of the most important factors in making political decisions. He later said that this estimate was less reliable and less useful because of the relatively small number of cases. However, when cases increase again, more attention will be paid to local and national R-rates. The goal is to keep the reproductive number below one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that the most important number?<br />\r\nThe reproducible number is one of the top three. The other is severity - some people have very mild ailments that don&#39;t cause much trouble. But the coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be serious and deadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latter is the number of cases that matter in deciding when to act. If you have a large number but loosen the limit so that the number of replicas is about one, you still have a large number of cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about the vaccine?<br />\r\nVaccines are another way to reduce reproductive numbers.

We are.&quot;<br />\r\nA former boxer of muscles, Hibbert is a band leader, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and performer whose concerts sometimes end with dozens of people dancing with him on stage. According to many, he is also the greatest reggae singer, so spiritual that he was able to turn &quot;Do re mi fa so la ti do&quot; into the national anthem. His husky tenor, unusually warm and harsh, has been compared to Otis Redding&#39;s voice, making him more accessible to American audiences than many reggae players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original songs like &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; and &quot;54-46 This is My Number&quot; have emotions and arrangements for calls and answers that soul and gospel fans know. Hibbert even recorded the American hit album &quot;Toots In Memphis,&quot; which was released in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never immersed in politics as his friend and contemporary of the great Bob Marley, Hibbert invoked heavenly justice in &quot;relieving pressure&quot;, preaching peace in &quot;revolution&quot;, justice in &quot;Bam Baam,&quot; and resenting drug arrests and closings. 1960. in &ldquo;54-46 This is my number. Almost unlike everyone else, he recorded everyday life in Jamaica in the years following his independence from Great Britain in 1962, regardless of whether he was worried about marriage (&quot;Sweet and Cool&quot;) or about paying the rent (&quot;Harsh Weather&quot; &quot;) speak. One of his most popular and surprising songs is the adaptation of John Denver&#39;s nostalgic Country Roads (Take Me Home), which transformed the West Virginia setting into the world that Hibbert is so familiar with.<br />\r\nLike other reggae stars, Hibbert&#39;s following increased following the release of the hit 1972 film Harder to Come, in which Jimmy Cliff emerged as a poor Jamaican who moved to Kingston and dreamed of a career in music. Jamaican productions are word of mouth in the US, and the soundtracks, often among the greatest in film history, include &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; and &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; by the Maytals. Hibbert also appears in the film as himself, recording &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; in the studio while Cliff&#39;s character watches in awe. Around the same time, the Maytals signed with Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Funky Kingston,&quot; which critic Lester Bangs described as &quot;the most compelling and diverse set of reggae songs by a single artist ever released.&quot; (This album will later be released in two different versions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the mid-1970s Keith Richards, John Lennon, Eric Clapton, and many other rock stars had become fans of reggae, and Hibbert ended up recording with some of them. The 2004 tribute album, Grammy-winning True Love, included cameos by Richards, Bonnie Wright, Ryan Adams, and Jeff Beck. Hibbert has also been the subject of the 2011 BBC documentary Reggae Got Soul, with Clapton, Richards and Willie Nelson as commentators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A visit to Saturday Night Live in 2004 brought Hibbert an unexpected admirer, guest host Donald Trump, who recalls hearing an example of a joke in his book, Think Like a Billionaire: &quot;My daughter, Ivanka, has told me how great you are and she is. right. The music relaxes me and surprisingly I wasn&#39;t nervous. &quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maytals were originally a vocal trio with Hibbert, Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; Mathias, and the band later added instrumentalists such as bassist Jackie Jackson and drummer Paul Douglas. They split in the early 1980s, but over the next decade, Hibbert began working with the new cast from the Maytals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hibbert&#39;s career came to a halt in 2013 after suffering head injuries from a bottle of vodka tossed at a concert in Richmond, Virginia, suffering from headaches and depression. But at the end of the decade, he made a comeback and released another album in 2020, &quot;Got To Be Tough,&quot; featuring contributions from Ziggy Marley and Ringo Starr, whose son Zak Starkey was co-producer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hibbert Grammy nominations include Best Reggae Album 2012 for Reggae Got Soul and Best Reggae Album 2007 for Light Your Light. Hibbert was ranked 71st on Rolling Stone&#39;s list of the 100 Greatest Contemporary Singers in 2008. In 2012, the Jamaican government awarded him an Order of Merit award for his outstanding contribution to country music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hibbert has been married to his wife Doreen for nearly 40 years and has eight children, including reggae actors Junior Hibbert and Leba Hibbert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frederick Nathaniel Hibbert (&quot;Toots&quot; is a childhood nickname) was born in May Pen, Clarendon Parish. He was the son of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, and he remembers the very long journey down the dirt road to school, the hours singing in church, and the private moments of listening to American radio stars such as Ray Charles and Elvis Presley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was young, his parents died and he moved to Trench Town in Kingston, where local music thrived. Moving from street parties to recording studios, he painted future stars like Bob Marley and Desmond Decker. He founded the Maytals, named after his hometown, with fellow singers Matthias and Gordon, began working with Jamaican producer Coxsone Dodd and quickly became the star of the national festival competitions starting in 1966.The Maytals (eventually renamed Toots &amp; the Maytals) won the year opening with &quot;Bam Bam&quot;, 1969 with &quot;Sweet and Dandy&quot; and 1972 with &quot;Pomp and Pride&quot;. Hibbert would joke that he thought it best to skip the festival as winning is so easy, despite returning in 2020 with bright and inspiring Rise Up Jamaica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maytals began when ska was the most popular piece of music, soaring during the transition to deferred rock rock and at the forefront of a faster, more danceable sound in the late 60s. His scandalous chant &quot;Do the Reggay&quot; is widely recognized as the song that gave reggae its name, even if the honor was not intentional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If a girl doesn&#39;t look so pretty or doesn&#39;t dress appropriately, we&#39;ll say she&#39;s lost. One day I was playing and I didn&#39;t know why, but I started singing, &#39;Do reggae, do reggay&#39; - keep it&quot;, he told the Stern newspaper. in 2012. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll call it streggay if I think about it a little longer.

Mass flow a. One of the most talked about aspects of the show are the clothes that shape the story of the protagonist Esti (played by Shira Haas) from start to finish.<br />\r\nThe show&#39;s costume designer, Justin Seymour, did hours of research, including a week-long stint at the Satmar community in New York. &quot;I consider one of the greatest gifts in my work to be very creative, but also very educational,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.<br />\r\n&quot;You have to be sensitive, respectful and informed when observing such a closed community,&quot; said Seymour, a non-Jew. She said she found that the women she met during her research had adopted designer brands for shoes, headscarves, and bags. &quot;Kate Spade, Chanel, Ferragamo and Hermes are all leading designers,&quot; he said, &quot;adding a little glamor to the conservative dress code.&quot;<br />\r\nWhether she washes thrift shops for silk scarves (she says she bought over 100 for the show) or makes faux leather straps (hats worn by married husbands, usually made of mink), Seymour says she works hard at ensuring that each costume fits. with Orthodox Jewish law, but also celebrates the nuances of individual style.<br />\r\nOrthodox clothing is often viewed by outsiders as too restrictive and leaves little room for individual freedom and self-expression. The fictional characters Feldman and Esti struggle against the pressure their community exerts, which affects their appearance. However, all three of the Jews interviewed for this article felt they had more freedom to explore their personal styles than other people. They may adopt - especially in less conservative households or chapters - and many devout women play with fashion to reflect their personal tastes while sticking to the religious dress code they follow.<br />\r\nOrthodox Judaism encompasses many traditions and customs, with the Williams Hasids only one group that is particularly wary. And while women living in these particular communities tend to follow stricter dress codes, followers of modern Orthodox, for example, choose to interpret some of the core principles differently.<br />\r\nSpecific codes of style differ from community to community, and dress is often dictated by practicality or religious events - Shabbat, Yom Tov (meaning holiday), weddings, and bar mitzvahs - as well as personal taste. But wherever you are or for whatever reason, in the world of Orthodox Jewry what you wear is determined by the concept of humility, which is called tzniut in Hebrew and tznius in Yiddish. From Tel Aviv to Massachusetts, clothes are chosen with clothing in mind.<br />\r\nTamara Fulton, a fashion stylist and lifestyle editor who is married to an Orthodox rabbi and lives in London, stated, &quot;There are many different Jewish communities around the world with great diversity, but their basic principles are the same. Tznius is an inner word. Judaism is easily misunderstood and means &quot;modesty&quot; but it is not just about modest clothing. Tznius applies to both men and women and is based on the concept of humility. It is really about how you are in the world and how you behave in a controlled but dignified manner, &quot; said Fulton.<br />\r\nFor Orthodox women, this usually means the following: there are no pants to wear, and skirts and dresses must fall below the knees, even when sitting. The arms are covered by the elbows and the cleavage is heavily cut. Clothes were changed frequently - with sewn slits in the skirt and additional cuts. Layering is also widely used to create the final look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_727,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200508080732-06-unorthodox-netflix-production-still.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nOnce you are married, covering your hair is another major principle in tznius. Not all women will shave their real hair like Esti did in one of The Unorthodox&#39;s most memorable scenes (her hair was totally shaved for her). But many observant women wear scarves or scarves, the Yiddish says for wigs.<br />\r\nA Jewish teacher who teaches at an all-girls school in Israel and who also lives in Haredi or the ultra-Orthodox community in Manchester, northern England, agreed to be interviewed for this article but asked not to be named. out of courtesy.<br />\r\nShe wears a scarf herself and explains that it can often be used as an accessory or as a means of changing your appearance. On the phone she said, &quot;One (woman) I know has different colored leaves with different styles. Because she said, &#39;I covered my head and thought of hats for hats.&#39; So if I want to be blonde one day and brown the next, why not? &quot;&quot;<br />\r\nThe hijab style also depends on the community. For example, some Hasidic women wore short wigs with a cap over them so that there was no doubt that they wore a head covering. Sheitels are made from human and synthetic hair. Whenever he lived in Manchester, his teachers always preferred to wear his human hair wigs on special occasions. &quot;I&#39;ll have real hair for Shabbat and then synthetic hair for every day,&quot; he said.<br />\r\nIt is also common to wear gifted jewelery on the Sabbath or on special occasions. &quot;It is believed that married women should have beautiful jewelry,&quot; said the teacher. &quot;Maybe simple, but high quality.&quot;<br />\r\nSeymour notes that jewelery is an important part of an &quot;unorthodox&quot; mix of costumes. She recalls having to dress up about 60 women for Esti and her husband&#39;s Yankees wedding scene, all in diamonds and pearls. Later in this scene, the groom presents his new bride with a pair of latticed diamond earrings. &quot;They were very close to the earrings Deborah Feldman received,&quot; he said.<br />\r\nAs in other cultures and religions, different colors meant different things, but black was not the only color that Hasidic women wore. &quot;When I lived in Israel, we almost never wore black,&quot; said the teacher. &quot;They are very light colors. But not red - never red! Because this color is not considered simple. (In the Hasidic community) women tend to wear dark blue, a bottle of green, brown and gray.&quot;<br />\r\n&ldquo;For all women, clothes are an expression of oneself. The idea is to look chic but don&#39;t attract too much attention, &rdquo;he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_727,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200602161118-01-unorthodox-fashion.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nOrthodox women buy clothes in a variety of places, from clothing stores owned by Jews in their community to other non-Jewish shops or malls. Fulton has several shops that often sell items that are suitable for them. &quot;I prefer wearing clothes that are designed to be worn as is, rather than overlaying or modifying modesty,&quot; he says. &quot;H&amp;M and Zara are good for that.&quot;<br />\r\nShe also noticed that many haute couture designers were producing collections that offered options for women who wanted to dress modestly. &quot;It&#39;s interesting to see how designers like Valentino, Erdem and McQueen, for example, come up with the right style for women who want to dress more modestly. I&#39;m also a big fan of the overall revival of the 70s inspired by Laura Ashley Design and brands like The Vampire Woman. &quot;&quot;<br />\r\nAnother brand that has become popular with attentive and secular women is Batsheva. The CFDA / Vogue Fashion Fund winning brand for 2018 is known for its ruffled, prairie-style dresses. Created by native New Yorker Batsheva Hey, the Fundamentals true to their name are centered around his personal history and culture.<br />\r\nHer husband, photographer Alexei Hay, started following Orthodox practices shortly before dating began. At their wedding, Batsheva, who grew up in a secular Jewish family and did not strictly adhere to the Jewish dress code, said men and women were separated, which is a tradition, and Haye wore her mother&#39;s wedding dress made of Mexican lace. and suitable for tznius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_727,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200525160153-orthodox-wedding-batsheva.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nWith no formal training in fashion design, Hay - a former lawyer - initially started making clothes while raising children at home.

In this way, he has developed a style that is humble but at the same time different and fun.<br />\r\n&quot;The aim of the Orthodox Jews is not to give up beauty,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to work on it to make it look beautiful.&quot;<br />\r\nSeymour echoed that feeling: &quot;In costumes at The Unorthodox, I want to honor women around the world who want to look beautiful without breaking the rules of modesty.&quot; He said he was impressed by the pride that many women in the Satmar Church have agreed to dress well in. &quot;If the show can bring a little more glamor and beauty and pride to our (all women&#39;s) clothes, I will be happy.&quot;</p>', 'Orthodox, interpretations', 'Orthodox_1600022436.jpg', '2020-09-13 22:40:36', '2021-08-18 02:58:06'),

Dark skin, Afro hair, and beautiful clothes (often by local designers) abound, and a diversity of gender and sexuality is evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_727,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200818141307-daniel-obasi-nigerian-stylist-2.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nAs part of a growing cultural scene in Lagos, Obassi has the opportunity to work with other Nigerian talents to make Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s vision a reality, including superstar Afrobeat Mr. Easy and Thebes Savage (both shot for Billboard June 2020) and designers Emmy Kasbit, Lanre Da Silva and Tola Adegbite from Turfah, with whom he has worked in the past.<br />\r\n&ldquo;This project is just a collection of people I love, people I respect, people who are my friends, people whose work I grew up as an artist. Great, like, &#39;You too? Oh wow! Oh my God , yes! &rdquo;he said.<br />\r\nSpeaking to CNN, Obassi shared his thoughts on community, fashion and the limitless possibilities of the imagination.<br />\r\nDaniel Obassi: Yes, you could say that, because this is a very contemporary work that talks about changes in African history. My work has always been tied to the fact that (African) stories are best told by Africans. We all have different experiences, but in all this diversity and under this difference, we still have things that tie us all together, you know?<br />\r\n(For me) It gives all of us this new opportunity to really work together and create beautiful works across all our different interfaces. It&#39;s always been about figuring out how to do this.<br />\r\nSome film critics disagree with this framework of cross-cultural exchange, pointing out that the lack of specificity that results from borrowing and combining different African cultures is problematic.<br />\r\nI wouldn&#39;t say it is cross-cultural in that sense because the creative direction comes from its end. Rather, it&#39;s about the fact that even a country like Nigeria is so diverse and has so many tribes. On a typical day, many of these tribes tend to live side by side not only for political reasons, but because of everything that has happened before all of us. So Black Is King united us all.<br />\r\nWhen we try to play the role of &quot;Key to the Kingdom&quot; (when the prince marries his master from childhood), it is very important to find a structure that speaks of Nigeria as a country. The place, the National Theater for the Arts (in Lagos), makes it really beautiful because it&#39;s a structure we can all look at and say, &quot;Oh my God, this is Nigeria.&quot;<br />\r\nWhen you look at artists making work from Ghana, when you see artists making work from South Africa, when you look at videos they are working on, you can see the power in the specificity of the culture. see where they are.<br />\r\nFor me this is an imaginary space where everything is infinite. In this room you can explore your past, future, and current ideas.<br />\r\nMany of them have to do with the fact that when we were growing up, we (Nigerians) didn&#39;t really have many references to futurism in our culture or in the stories they told us. In addition, much of our history is lost or damaged, even making the past feel very hazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afrofuturism gives you this space to determine for yourself what your future holds and what you believe in. Often it feels very personal. I love to see cases in culture, in society, in politics, in things that I and the people I know went through as I grew up creating my own alternative reality. Many of the works and stories we see today are either very negative or very contradictory, so Afrofuturism can be a space of healing, a space where you can run away and believe that things can get better.<br />\r\nWhen did you first recognize the power of imaging and fashion as a tool for building the world?<br />\r\nWhen I was young I was in a lot of amazing stories that we grew up with like (Nigerian Kids TV Show) (Moonlight Stories), about the animal kingdom where animals can talk and other things that would happen on a normal day wouldn&#39;t real; and stories and books like writers painting a world that doesn&#39;t look like anything you saw when you left the house. Its brightness and specificity allow you to see that thoughts are really very powerful.<br />\r\nOne of the things I love about fashion is the fact that it works that way. You can walk into this space and get inspired by the idea of ​​shape or form, using materials or clothing to create a style, look or feel that doesn&#39;t exist, and people will relate to it or not. It depends on how far you can think or how well you can strengthen your imagination.<br />\r\nIn your films and photos, you often try to lift and find beauty in historically marginalized groups. What political potential does the production of an image like this have?<br />\r\nI think the most important thing about pictures is that they talk a lot. You don&#39;t even have to say much about a good picture. I like to think about what we are doing in and about ourselves with subtle and calm activism.<br />\r\nWhen we talk about beauty in this country - or even the world - we have issues that are visually linked to skin politics and gender. We work in a very materialistic industry and see image as (a reflection of one&#39;s point of view). Therefore, it is very important for me to differentiate (my work) as a platform and use it to say what I want to say.<br />\r\nI&#39;m talking about natural hair; I really (realized) that I wasn&#39;t spending any more touching on the skin to reveal the beauty of what black skin looks like. In terms of gender, I have always positioned women in positions of strength, power and beauty. and when you look at masculinity, weirdness, and all that, society teaches you that you can&#39;t be so masculine.<br />\r\nThese are things we experience every day. So it&#39;s important that I always find a way to put this forward in one way or another. We&#39;re in a place where everyone&#39;s nice to talk about these things, but three years ago it wasn&#39;t very good.<br />\r\nThis year alone you did &quot;Black Is King,&quot; a stylish editorial for Dazed and The Face, and featured in i-D magazine. What do you want to achieve next?<br />\r\nI love making experimental films so I think this is the next film I hope to work on soon. In terms of goals, I try to strengthen myself not only as a creative person, but also as an entrepreneur. Besides, I don&#39;t know. Everything can fly from anywhere.</p>', 'Beyonce Daniel Obassi, future', 'Daniyal famous designer_1600329202.jpg', '2020-09-17 11:53:22', '2021-12-19 17:29:16'),

And he set a timetable for when the general public in the US can expect the outcome of the widespread coronavirus vaccination in the second or third quarter of 2021. Both statements appear to contradict what Trump said.<br />\r\n&quot;I can even say further that this mask protects me more from Covid than if I got the Covid vaccine because the immunogenicity can be 70%. And if I don&#39;t get an immune response, the vaccine won&#39;t protect me. This face mask Redfield told lawmakers during public testimony, adding that the American public has not accepted the use of masks to a level that can control the outbreak effectively.<br />\r\nIn response to testimony from the Redfield Congress, Trump stepped forward against the doctor he appointed to lead the CDC and challenged the agency&#39;s head on two counts: the coronavirus vaccination schedule and the effectiveness of masks versus vaccinations. .<br />\r\nRedfield told the Budget Committee on Wednesday, &quot;If you ask me when it will be publicly available to the American public so we can use the vaccine to return to our normal lives, we might think of a third.&quot; end of second quarter, third quarter of 2021. &quot;<br />\r\nThe president told reporters that Redfield was &quot;confused&quot; when he said this.<br />\r\n&quot;I think he made a mistake in saying that.

He was not referring to the duration of the Covid-19 dose. A vaccine will be available for all Americans, &quot;said the spokesman.<br />\r\nThis is not the first time Trump has forced Redfield to reconsider its response to the pandemic.<br />\r\nEarlier this year, Trump said Redfield misquoted in the Washington Post before doctors confirmed his quote was correct.<br />\r\nThe commute comes a day after the Trump White House held a peace treaty ceremony with senior officials from three countries who largely ignore distancing and social disguise guidelines - and the president called it awkward and unjustifiable being part of the &quot;servant&quot;.

And I saw them a few days ago when they served me and played with masks. I don&#39;t blame them. ... They play with masks. ... They touch them and then they hit the plate. Not that could be good, &quot;Trump said.<br />\r\nThe president sometimes wears a mask and says it&#39;s important. But his actions sent a different message to his supporters: the White House and Trump re-election campaigns also ignored CDC guidelines, government guidelines and local health officials, leaving large crowds of athletes standing side by side and wearing no masks.<br />\r\nOther senior health officials in the Trump administration, including Adm. Brett Giroard, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Dr. Bob Cadletz, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the Department of Health and Human Services, also testified on Wednesday of the importance of wearing masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.<br />\r\nAfter Trump questioned the effectiveness of ABC masks, spokeswoman Kaylee McEnnany told reporters Wednesday that the president &quot;has always supported wearing masks&quot;.<br />\r\n&quot;Yesterday he quoted an incident recorded by Dr. (Anthony) Fauci, which means that masks can have unintended consequences.

But what exactly is it and how does it apply to vaccines?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An emergency license, as the name suggests: a medical device that has received specific approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for use in an emergency. Sometimes it&#39;s a product that has been FDA approved but under different conditions, and sometimes it&#39;s a new product that hasn&#39;t received the go-ahead from the agency.<br />\r\nThere is concern and ongoing debate about whether a vaccine candidate should be given EEA - or direct approval - without first completing a Phase 3 clinical trial. According to the FDA website, in the case of a public health emergency, the agency could use an emergency. Use approval &quot;to assist in the delivery of medical devices as quickly as possible by delivering unapproved medical devices to patients in need when there are no adequate, FDA approved and available alternatives.&quot; However, this is only the case if the &quot;known and potential benefits of the product in diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition identified are greater than the known risks and potential of the product&quot;.<br />\r\nSo, the EEA essentially sped up the process of procuring potentially useful medical devices approved for specific public use during emergency medical care, without the rigorous testing and follow-up normally required to get FDA approval - the traditional one. It took years.<br />\r\nWhen emergency medical care ends, &quot;the EEA issued under this statement will cease to apply,&quot; according to the FDA. However, manufacturers can still send documents to agencies for routine approval.<br />\r\nThe EEA hasn&#39;t been around that long. The process was incorporated into the project Biological Shield Act, passed by Congress in 2004, which allows the federal government to prepare and enforce new &quot;medical precautions&quot; during declared public health emergencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And despite the publication of multiple EUAs over the years, only one vaccine has ever received one - but this is an unusual and controversial fact. In 1997, the Department of Defense initiated a mandatory anthrax vaccination program. Shortly thereafter, the soldiers claimed that the vaccine had made them sick, so they and a judge withheld the 2003 program. The Department of Defense urged the EEA, which then overturned a 2005 court ruling so that it could continue to vaccinate military personnel. - this time on a voluntary basis.<br />\r\nEUA during this pandemic<br />\r\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA repeatedly gave EUA various medical devices, such as ventilators. personal protective equipment including masks; Molecular and antigen tests to diagnose Covid-19 and serological tests for antibodies; and even medications such as remdezivir and plasma recovery. Like hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, EUA can be withdrawn. These drugs have been approved for the treatment and prevention of malaria and hold promise against new laboratory tests for the coronavirus. Early small studies in patients with Covid-19 are optimistic and the drug is being promoted by PresidentTrump. However, larger studies have shown that the drug is ineffective in treating patients with Covid-19. In addition, one of the side effects can also be potentially dangerous in people with a history of heart disease. After about two and a half months in the EEA, the emergency clearance was revoked.<br />\r\nMany experts believe that giving EUA a vaccine against Covid-19 is problematic. First, vaccines are given to selected healthy people, compared to drugs given to seriously ill patients who might die without them. So, so to speak, drug manufacturers have raised the bar to ensure there are no unexpected side effects that make healthy people sick - and the only way to find out is with large-scale research like the one that&#39;s being done. .<br />\r\nThe FDA has announced that they will keep the vaccine at a higher standard. Dr. Peter Marx, director of the FDA&#39;s Center for Organic Product Evaluation and Research, said Thursday that the requirements are stricter than emergency approvals for experimental drugs.<br />\r\n&quot;For us, for a vaccine that has sufficient production information, emergency clearance, if we give emergency clearance, will really be a plus emergency,&quot; Marx said at a seminar organized by Duke University&#39;s Margolis Center for Health Policy. has been arranged.<br />\r\nOn Friday, Marx and Hahn said in a joint blog post that they would &quot;soon&quot; issue more guidelines on how high the standard was.<br />\r\nThey found that producers had to submit an application to the FDA or EEA for full approval, which is known as a license application for organic products. With so many stakes at stake, we understand the importance of being as transparent as possible about our work, including how we make decisions about the COVID-19 vaccine, &rdquo;wrote Marx and Hahn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FDA has announced that it wants at least 50% effectiveness - meaning that any vaccine under consideration should reduce the risk of infection or serious illness by at least 50% compared to a placebo.<br />\r\nIn a series of tweets from Dr. Peter Hottes, Professor and Dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, stated earlier this month that &quot;EUA contains poor quality or poor feedback. Something is being injected into tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of Americans?&quot; &quot;<br />\r\nIn addition, Hotez pointed out that the mRNA technology used in the two most advanced Phase 3 vaccines - Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTechvaccine - &quot;is a new technology that has not been licensed before&quot;. We have no history or experience with such vaccines. Even more reason for a full / comprehensive review. &quot;&quot;<br />\r\nHotes also pointed out that in this highly politicized climate, there is a lack of trust in government and federal agencies. &quot;We see the White House abusing the EEA mechanism in 2020 - don&#39;t forget the EEA for hydroxychloroquine, which has been abolished? Neither the White House nor the HHS division,&quot; he wrote on Twitter.<br />\r\nPolitical subtext<br />\r\nThere are also concerns that the president is seeking a vaccine for political reasons in preparation for the November elections.<br />\r\nPresident Trump has said several times that he believes a vaccine could be available on election day. Undoubtedly, the pace of medical innovation is moving faster than ever, and human trials of vaccines began just 67 days after the virus was first identified. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently urged public health officials to prepare for potential vaccine distribution by the end of October. And FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said he would consider the EEA before completing the Phase 3 trials.<br />\r\nHowever, several health officials told CNN that the idea of ​​making a vaccine publicly available on November 3 was unlikely. &quot;There is great concern about the nature of the political expediency, and when that [October] date is chosen ... and just choosing that date before the election triggers fears that the government is not too busy, make sure that Every Vaccine Is Really Not only effective, but also has a little side effects, &rdquo;said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and former director of the CDC&#39;s Public Health Services.<br />\r\n&quot;We&#39;re all optimistic that there are currently three vaccines in Phase 3. Maybe one of those vaccines is so great that you don&#39;t have to vaccinate 30,000 people to see it work.&quot; However, there is a concern that if you don&#39;t do all these so-called phase 3 studies, you will miss out on rare side effects, &quot;he told CNN earlier this month.<br />\r\nWhen vaccines - other medical devices - are given sufficiently, rare side effects can occur. In 1976, the government released a vaccine, which was produced hastily, about seven months after the Ford government became convinced that a new strain causing a pandemic was imminent.<br />\r\nThe pandemic never happened, but 40 million people were vaccinated as part of the mandatory program. This vaccine is then associated with a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, which can develop after infection or, rarely, after vaccination with live vaccines. The connection was never made, but the program was terminated.<br />\r\nTo demonstrate vaccine effectiveness, dozens of people in the placebo arm had to be infected, while very few, if any, infections were observed in the vaccinated cohort of study participants. It can take weeks, even months, to determine the difference between these two populations.<br />\r\nLess confident<br />\r\nThis lack of doubt in public is real. A CNN poll in August found that 40 percent of Americans don&#39;t want to get a vaccine once it&#39;s available - even if it&#39;s cheap and easy to get. Such low vaccine uptake could affect a country&#39;s ability to control the virus and return to normal.<br />\r\nIf history is any guide, skepticism - if not outright suspicion - of an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. In a study published in 2009, months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 flu and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, researchers looked at people&#39;s willingness to use drugs or vaccines with EUA (not fully approved by the FDA). by interviewing a representative sample of more than 1,500 adults in the United States.<br />\r\nThey found that more than 77% of respondents would become very, very or very worried if they were offered an unapproved vaccine. 63% said they would not accept it.<br />\r\nHowever, there were several other key factors that convinced respondents that EEA-approved vaccines were safe to use. When the vaccine was given by health workers, 55% of respondents said they would drink it. If accompanied by an information sheet, more than 57% of respondents said they would get it. And when they are managed by their healthcare providers, that figure is 68%. Transparency is the key to trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The head of the state health authority - Alex Hazard of the US Department of Health, Dr. Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Anthony Fauzi of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. FDA Stephen Hahn and Dr. The CDC&#39;s Robert Redfield is all trying to convince Americans that politics won&#39;t be a problem if a vaccine is available.<br />\r\nFauci said he believes a vaccine is likely to get closer towards the end of the year and that he will not be comfortable making a vaccine widely available unless it is supported by science. &quot;I am not a regulator. I mean, I just do science. I will report science accurately and I will definitely be very concerned and screaming if I see interference,&quot; Fauzi told CNN&#39;s Jim Acosta in the Situation Room. .<br />\r\nRegarding emergency clearance, &quot;I would not be comfortable with a vaccine unless it is proven in clinical studies to be safe and effective,&quot; Faucisaid said in an interview with NBCs Today.<br />\r\nDr. Luciana Borio, former FDA chief scientist, agrees that most importantly, vaccines need to be proven safe and effective.<br />\r\nButifa has been shown to be safe and effective in appropriate and well-controlled clinical studies and should not be maintained until all the strict FDA approval requirements have been met because some requirements cannot be established quickly. .<br />\r\nSafe and effective vaccines can save lives and help fight the pandemic, Boris wrote on Twitter. &quot;The EEA is the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for vaccine distribution that has been shown to be safe and effective in Phase 3 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) but does not yet meet all FDA approval standards.&quot;<br />\r\nMoncef Slavey, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the federal government&#39;s Covid-19 vaccination program, said it was &quot;unethical&quot; not to take swift action to release the Covid-19 vaccine if proven successful.<br />\r\n&quot;If we know that the vaccine is 70%, 80% or 90% effective, it would be unethical to store it,&quot; Slavey said in an interview with CNN on Friday.<br />\r\nOn Tuesday, nine biopharmaceutical companies, including those at the forefront of their vaccine testing programs, signed an unusual commitment to &quot;high ethical standards&quot; on the condition that they would not seek preliminary regulatory approval for the Covid-19 vaccine.<br />\r\nThey promise to &quot;submit emergency clearance or approval only after demonstrating the safety and efficacy of a phase 3 clinical trial designed and conducted in accordance with the requirements of regulatory agencies such as the FDA.&quot;<br />\r\nIn fact, on the same day, AstraZeneca, one of the signatories, said it had stopped testing around the world for an unexplained disease in a volunteer in the UK. Drug manufacturers call suspensions a &quot;routine measure.&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;Disease occurred accidentally in a large study but needs to be independently verified for careful verification. We are working to accelerate the review of a single event to minimize the potential impact on the study plan,&quot; the statement said. Statement sent to CNN.<br />\r\nAccording to FDA guidelines, any vaccine - whether emergency or approved - must prevent disease or reduce its severity by at least 50%.<br />\r\nFor all intrigue, it may be worthwhile to revert to the original EEA criteria - particularly the provision that they should only be assigned if &quot;no reasonable, approved and available alternatives&quot;. It&#39;s understandable that most people don&#39;t do this, but I don&#39;t want to hear them. There are reasonable alternatives that have worked well in many parts of the world and follow basic public health measures: wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, maintaining good hand hygiene, and avoiding large crowds, especially indoors.<br />\r\nFollowing these rules will greatly reduce the chances of people getting sick and slow the transmission of the virus. It will also give us more time to make sure we get vaccine evidence, which is really blown away.</p>', 'EEA, Coronavirus, Vaccine', 'Vaccine_1600342015.jpg', '2020-09-17 15:26:56', '2021-08-12 00:14:30'),

AstraZeneca, which is conducting a global study of the vaccine it makes with the University of Oxford, said volunteers from the sample had recovered from severe spinal cord infections and were no longer hospitalized.<br />\r\nAstraZeneca did not confirm that the patient had transverse myelitis, but Nat and other neurologists said they understood it. Transverse myelitis causes a number of symptoms, including inflammation of the spinal cord, which can lead to pain, muscle weakness, and paralysis. British regulators, regulators for medicines and health products, are investigating the case and allowing a retrial.<br />\r\nAstraZeneca &quot;needs to be more open about the potential complications of the vaccine that will eventually be given to millions of people,&quot; said Nat. &quot;We wanted to see how we could help, but the lack of information made it difficult.&quot;<br />\r\nThe decision to proceed with the study is complicated because it is difficult to determine the cause of the rare injuries that occurred during vaccination studies - and because scientists and authorities need to assess the risk of unusual side effects to a potential vaccine to limit a pandemic.<br />\r\n&quot;There are many factors involved in this decision,&quot; said Nat. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt a healthy person.&quot;<br />\r\nThe NIH has not yet collected tissue or blood samples from the British patient and the investigation is &quot;in the planning stages,&quot; Nat said. US researchers can examine samples from other vaccinated patients to see if any antibodies produced in response to the coronavirus also attack brain tissue or the spinal cord.<br />\r\nSuch a study could take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it will take before deciding on another decision.<br />\r\nDr. Jesse Goodman, a professor and doctor at Georgetown University, chief scientist and chief vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency would review the data and possibly consult with previous UK regulators to allow the US investigation to proceed, which had only just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also under follow-up studies in the United States<br />\r\nIf damage in the UK study is found to be caused by a vaccine, the FDA can suspend the interrupt. If it can be continued, regulators and scientists will definitely look for similar symptoms in other test takers.<br />\r\nOne volunteer in the early stages of the AstraZeneca study had a similar side effect, but the researchers found she had multiple sclerosis that was not related to vaccination, according to Dr. Elliott Froman, director of the Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology at the University of Texas. .<br />\r\nNeuroscientists who study diseases such as transverse myelitis say they are rare - at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people - and most often because of the body&#39;s immune response to the virus. Less often, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.<br />\r\nThe exact cause of the disease is key to the authorities&#39; decision on whether to continue with the process. Sometimes the underlying medical condition is &quot;exposed&quot; by a person&#39;s immune response to the vaccine, resulting in illness, as occurs in MS patients. In this case, the test can be continued without fear because the disease is not vaccine-specific.<br />\r\nEven more worrying is the phenomenon of &quot;molecular mimicry&quot;. In such cases, small portions of the vaccine may look like tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on those tissues in response to the vaccine components. If so, it is likely that transverse myelitis will recur when the test is restarted, Dr said. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The second case will end the process, he said.<br />\r\nIn 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was stopped when doctors began diagnosing a similar disease, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, in people receiving the vaccine. At the time, no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to know if the episodes were vaccine-related.<br />\r\nFinally, the researchers found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by one more case in the 100,000 vaccinated patients. The regular seasonal flu shot increases the risk of GBS in about one more case per 1 million people.<br />\r\n&quot;It&#39;s very, very difficult to know if a rare event was caused by a vaccine,&quot; said Schaffner. &quot;How do you relate increased risk to something that happens to one in a million people?&quot;<br />\r\nBefore the FDA allows testing to resume in the US, it wants to find out why the company and the UK&#39;s Independent Data Security and Monitoring Panel (DSMB) believe it is safe to continue, Goodman said. AstraZeneca processes in the US have a separate security notice.<br />\r\nFDA officials should review the full details of the case and request more information about the study volunteers concerned before deciding whether to pursue the US study, Goodman said. AstraZeneca may also need to update the safety information provided to study participants.<br />\r\nIt is possible that the volunteers&#39; health problems were accidental that had nothing to do with the vaccine, said Dr. Amesh Adalya, a senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Usually, research doesn&#39;t stop at health problems, even if they are serious.<br />\r\nHowever, many leading health authorities have expressed disappointment that AstraZeneca has not released any further information on the health issues that have caused AstraZeneca to close its UK litigation.&quot;There is so little information that it is impossible to understand what the diagnosis is or why the DSMB and sponsors are convinced,&quot; Goodman said.<br />\r\nAstraZeneca said it could not provide further information on the health issue as it would violate patient privacy, although it did not specify how.<br />\r\nHowever, there is an urgent need for transparency in a political climate shaped by the volatility of vaccines and distrust of the Trump administration&#39;s handling of COVID-19, leading scholars say.<br />\r\n&quot;While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I thought it would be helpful to know how they perceive this issue,&quot; Goodman said. &quot;What is the diagnosis? If there is no clear diagnosis, what makes you feel like this research can be restarted? The interest and potential concern about the COVID-19 vaccine is so great that the more information that is provided the more convincing.&quot;<br />\r\nThe FDA must consider all possible risks of experimental vaccines against the threat of COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.<br />\r\n&quot;There are also potential consequences if you stop the research,&quot; Goodman said.<br />\r\nIf the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the US government will support six more COVID-19 vaccines in the hope that at least one will work. The potential problem with the AstraZeneca vaccine shows that it is a wise investment, said Adalya.<br />\r\n&quot;That&#39;s part of the idea of ​​not just having one vaccine candidate in front of you,&quot; he said. &quot;This gives you a little more insurance.&quot;<br />\r\nSchaffner says researchers must remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.<br />\r\n&quot;Investigators are inadvertently hiding their own vaccine,&quot; said Schaffner. &quot;The Oxford investigators were there this summer and said, &#39;We&#39;ll get there first.&#39; But that&#39;s why ... Dr. [Anthony] Fauzi and the rest of us said, &quot;You never know what would happen if you had gone through extensive human testing.&quot;</p>', 'NIH, AustaZeneca', 'Nih_1600342474.jpg', '2020-09-17 15:34:34', '2021-09-23 08:16:33'),

Instead of the thousands of titles stuck in parts of the program, there are 50 that are simply gorgeous. Blame it on the pandemic. The release plan has been revised, some films will wait until 2021. Netflix is ​​increasing as registrants revise the qualification rules. However, the selection of decorative items in Toronto is procedural and we have to respect the films that make the jump knowing they will land on unstable ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a letter of intent that happened in Toronto from the very beginning. Other festivals such as Cannes remain; Telluride followed suit. Venice and Toronto are fighting well and New York and London are at the front, but as a launch pad they don&#39;t have the same spring this year. The propulsion relies on red carpet gastronomy and pressed meat from industry insiders and the opinion of sleepless and overly caffeinated journalists. It helps to have everything in one place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, press screenings in Toronto are held on virtual portals, while public screenings are limited online and in theaters. The stars enter via zoom. These can never be compared, but the systems stick together and bring new cultural insights to living rooms around the world. Because the arts plan their opposition to the economic realities of Covid-19, this is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What did it mean in those strange years for films to come out against the backdrop of a pandemic? The traditional trajectory for many - Autumn Festival thunderbolts, passing the end of the year, and continuing to compete for prizes - has turned into a bigger marathon with Oscars postponed to April (this may be optimistic). It took some of these films a long time to see a normal release. Some may be lost in the delay between when the pandemic ends and when it ends. On the other hand, a less crowded program leaves more room for the film to be screened more deeply than a sip of thin air the fall festival fairs hold. Success can still turn into a little golden man in the spring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, maybe this fall will take a little peek at the horizon and explore more of what&#39;s on our feet.

Chloe Zhao&#39;s exquisite creative work immersed Francis McDormand in the little-known American baby boomer culture of adopting a nomadic lifestyle. Their reasons are diverse: financial ruin, disappointment, personal loss. McDormand Fern&#39;s character was all over the top, losing her husband as well as her city - Empire, Nevada - when the American cast closed in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sight that drives your converted van through the Badlands to the west coast is breathtaking, lively and hard and the friendship warm. While Fern is fiction, most players are real people, and interactions are strongest in this confined space. McDormand, who appears as kind-hearted Sasha Baron Cohen, replaces the truths of a unique American reality in exchange for friendship and compassion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not homeless, I&#39;m homeless,&quot; Fern said, &quot;it&#39;s not the same.&quot; Zhao and McDormand&#39;s creation is a unique work, beautifully completed, similar to something we&#39;ve never seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;Pieces of a Woman&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criticism was also shared by Cornell&#39;s bad-mouth melodrama, but what was undeniable was the change in power that host Vanessa Kirby (&quot;The Crown&quot;) gave her. The Hungarian director starts off with a 30-minute sequence where husband Martha and Kirby Sean (Shia LaBoeuf) have a home delivery, which is tragically wrong. What begins playfully and lovingly becomes satisfying and exciting to the heart; honestly the unspoken image of loss as one can imagine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s an experience that the couple and the film will never recover from - that&#39;s how strong an early volley, whatever follows it, will always be a step down in dramatic stakes. But Martha&#39;s calm determination and anguish was skillfully played by Kirby, bringing &quot;Pieces of a Woman&quot; to a satisfying conclusion. This is already an award-winning achievement that earned her the Volpi Cup for best actress in Venice. More gongs could follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;Limbo&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200917180519-tiff-2020-limbo-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British indie greats won hearts in Toronto after being announced in the official Cannes elections earlier this year. Set on a remote Scottish island, Ben Sharrock&#39;s play shares many of the same themes as nomadic land - displacement, loss, isolation, raw nature - but operates at a higher stakes because neither side chooses to be there. Where.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We follow Omar (Amir El-Masri), a Syrian asylum seeker living in a windy purgatory, waiting for his case to be tried. He wandered around the island, carrying his limbs and the weight of the world on his shoulders, and phoned his parents in Turkey and asked him to come back. But he is determined to find friendly ties with Afghanistan and loyal fans of Freddie Mercury Farhad (Gulf of Vikash) and West African brothers Abedi (Kwabena Ansah) and Wassef (Ola Orebie), all on their mission to stay in Britain. united. Some applications succeed, others tragically fail. Meanwhile, a course on &quot;cultural awareness&quot; should be followed to humiliate everyone involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The still waters flow deep into El-Masri&#39;s restrained appearance, while the situation propels Omar through 4: 3 cameraman Nick Cook&#39;s composition. It is a serene and beautiful story that is easy to find in unexpected places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;I Care a Lot&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200917175639-tiff-2020-i-care-a-lot-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know thriller is dark when it starts with the uncontrollable exploits of a parent, but what&#39;s fun is &quot;I&#39;m so worried.&quot; Jay Blackeson&#39;s film wasted no time paving its way to a moral abyss, and Rosamund Pike was behind the wheel, restoring the recklessness of Frozen who was last seen in David Fincher&#39;s The Gone Girl. Pike plays Marla Grayson, a professional guardian whose goal is to lock himself in a nursing home and pocket his fortune in his corporate pocket. He was the supreme leech and proud that he was truly good at it. But when a new client (Diane West) proves difficult because of her extraordinary and violent relationship, Grayson decides that attack is the best form of defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, the film takes a completely different perspective and is constantly changing gears. Salty, sour and seasoned with real poison, little if anyone could take root, but it&#39;s nice to see everyone squeeze it. &quot;Trust me, no one is good,&quot; said Grayson in his opening voice. Yes, not kidding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Apples&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christo Nikus&#39; drama about the amnesia pandemic lives in the same absurd and disturbing world as George Lantimos (&quot;The Favorite&quot;) - which makes sense if you find out that Niko was once an assistant director. However, this extraordinary debut, which focuses on interrupting human work and restoring one&#39;s sense of self - good, bad, painful - is characterized by its tenderness. This is thanks in large part to his host Aris Servetalis and the compassionate eyes of Niku, who proclaimed himself to be the most important new voice in the Greek New Wave. It is hoped that greater things will come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Beans&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tracy Deere&#39;s adult film is unlike any other adult film where this Mohawk Tekehenthahva girl has an experience most young people have never had. The story takes place in the midst of the 1990 Oka Crisis, a land dispute between Mohawk and authorities over plans to build a holy cemetery in Quebec, Canada. It was inspired by events from the director&#39;s childhood. Deer find a canal in the newcomer Kiawentiio, the tekehentahkhwa (peanuts of his friends) moving in the middle of a blockade and armed conflict in danger that was famous in his youth. As tensions mount, even a child is not free from abuse by an increasingly angry audience - and citing past documentaries, Deer added archival footage to aid criticism in the script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History tells us this story has a happy ending, but Deer never satisfied the audience and the film won its streak of wins. And like a light in the dark, Kiawentiio&#39;s meaningless feat was a breakthrough that was sure to attract additional attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;New Order&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Franco&#39;s latest film isn&#39;t for everyone. The highly cynical drama bordering on the nihilistic and cutting-edge revolutionary drama of the Mexican provocateurs has something to say, and he puts it in a very grim manner. But it&#39;s definitely not boring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the opening of the busy hospital with our patients being discharged, we moved on to civil marriage. Sirens sound in the distance as guests sip champagne and feel safe in their paved surroundings. The revolution was not recognized, and certainly not the proletariat, who started painting Mexico City a beautiful green. But to paraphrase Mike Tyson, everyone has a plan until they get a gun in the face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bride Marian (Nai&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez Norvind) is kidnapped and the family and house employees do everything they can to get her back while the police and military create a military zone in the city. One act of violence follows another, as power plays turn characters into pawns in a game of chess that they never wanted to play (even if their lifestyle had lowered the board).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franco appears to be working on the thesis that, rather than inspiring a better world, unrest is something that can be used to consolidate power. The film&#39;s prestige is as threatening as it is with a worrying conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Another Round&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can live continuously, will that be an improvement? This is the question behind Thomas Winterberg&#39;s drunken comedy about four middle-aged teachers who experiment on themselves to take away their excitement. At the suggestion of storyteller Martin (Mads Mickelsen, who reproduces his relationship with Winterberg), they target a blood alcohol level of 0.05% and take it from there. Of course, things get confusing in both professional and personal life, but like any good scientist they at least take notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mickelsen shows a vulnerable side a million miles from his big (and perhaps career-defining) change when Hannibal Lecter, and supporters Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Rant and Magnus Milang add quite a punch to the story. It would be too easy to call &quot;Another Round&quot; another comedy about a midlife crisis. There is a lot of soul - and soul searching - with laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Toronto International Film Festival is coming to an end, but the competition for awards has only just begun.

After several delays related to the coronavirus, starting with a scheduled release in March, Disney disbanded and decided to offer the film via the Disney + streaming service for a premium price of $ 30. Although the film will be available to subscribers at no additional cost at a later date, Mulan became experiments in home entertainment, consumer preferences, and models that develop a balance between theater exhibition and streaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This carries a lot of illegal, perhaps unfair, burdens to the film, in many ways the protagonist Mulan (Yifei Liu) has to bear the brunt of her family. For him, it was once again a decision to let his beloved exhumed father (Qi Ma) die, defend the country or steal his armor, disguise himself as a young man, and register to respond to the call to fend off the invasion. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the bones of the previous film and which &quot;the narrative poem Balada Mulan&quot; suggests. But this new &quot;Mulan&quot; - directed by Nicki Caro, based on a script associated with the writers&#39; quartet - has an underwater stream that&#39;s very Star Wars-like. As it turns out, Mulan has greatness within herself and must take this mysterious power (her &quot;Chi&quot;) to let go of her &quot;warrior&quot; heart and fulfill her destiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from this relationship, there is a powerful magician, Xianyang (Gong Li), who is also trapped in a patriarchal society that does not accept his talent. He responds by using his gift to help invaders from the north, whose ruthless leader Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) longs for revenge on the emperor (the unrecognizable Jet Li).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This structure not only raises the issue of &quot;women&#39;s power&quot;, but also the idea that detention for legal proceedings itself has the potential to lead to a dark side. First Mulan said, &quot;Learn your place.&quot; He is then warned by his useless commander (Donny Jenas The Deceiver) that the deception is a one-way street to drive out and humiliate the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a fine cast and features a much-exposed acrobatic martial arts stunt for the first time in the US in &quot;The Thieving Tiger, the Hidden Dragon&quot;. The film is well shot and full of bright colors and lots of action - some of which might be a little intense for younger kids, which is reflected in the PG-13 ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emotional crux of the film lies in the father-son relationship, but Liu&#39;s appearance works on many levels, expressing discomfort, guilt and humor in the continuation of his barracks - little question, no shower - to see how men behave and speak when women there is no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the harsher tone, losing the music was probably the right choice, although the song &quot;Reflection&quot; was played over the final track sung by Christina Aguilera and Liu in English and Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a clever callback, but when Mulan went her own way she found it bolder than some of the other straightforward Disney adaptations - think Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin - which followed and followed the line of animation closely the amount of cash coming out of a prince.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even if they accept creative risks, they award unequal rewards - a solid, shaky film that doesn&#39;t resemble the elusive fairytale dust known as Disney magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, Mulan has great respect for the story while building her independence from previous versions, complex operations that were successful in measured doses. The big unknown remains how much of this will eventually bring to the studio, which thanks to gambit streaming has become a more interesting topic and perhaps the most enduring part of its legacy.</p>', 'Mulan, Star wars', 'Lossing song_1600588686.jpg', '2020-09-20 11:58:06', '2021-08-10 20:23:04'),

The show has progressed.<br />\r\n&quot;The government and police have created a very mature environment for conspiracy theories to flourish,&quot; said Anthony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of City on Fire, a riot book. &quot;Both the police and the government are reporting events that are very much at odds with the objective experience of those who saw them in person or online.&quot;<br />\r\nViolent protests such as tear gas, petrol bombs and police accusations can confuse the following events even for those directly involved. The riots in Hong Kong were widely broadcast live, but not all of them were caught on camera - leaving gaps in knowledge where conspiracy theories could develop.<br />\r\nPolice denied allegations of using excessive force and using tear gas and other weapons too quickly, citing difficulties in controlling the protests that were large and often chaotic over long periods of time.<br />\r\nAlthough allegations of brutality continued to be forwarded to the authorities in the months following the June 2019 protests, a number of events have instilled public confidence in the dive. In late July, police were charged with readiness when bandits attacked protesters at a subway station in the northern city of Yuen Long. The following month, video shows officials violently storming the subway at Prince Edward Station and beating protesters and bystanders when they call for help. Separately, the police also faced allegations of sexual assault by a number of demonstrators, both during arrest and at the police station. The police have consistently denied this allegation.<br />\r\nPrior to Chan&#39;s death, there were unsubstantiated rumors that several people had died in the incident with Prince Edward. Although the bereaved person&#39;s family never appeared and there are no public records from the Hong Kong government to back up the claim, the theory soon became factual for many protesters and the station became a memorial covered in flowers.<br />\r\nA man who disappeared in connection with the events at that time finally appeared last month. In a video posted online, he said he fled to England two weeks before Prince Edward&#39;s protests for fear of being arrested.<br />\r\n&quot;He didn&#39;t come out early to disperse the tariff because he didn&#39;t want to help the police,&quot; said Paul Yip, director of the University of Hong Kong Suicide Research and Prevention Center. &quot;It&#39;s all very, very sad when you see the distrust between people and the police.&quot;<br />\r\nDapiran blamed Hong Kong authorities for breaches of trust, citing long delays in speaking to the public after major events - such as the Ewan Long attack - and the way senior officials spread conspiracy theories about alleged foreign leadership in the protests. .<br />\r\n&quot;All of this shows a lack of government leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;If the authorities abandon responsibility or disappear, as the government did for weeks last year, and / or if there is no trust in the authorities, a vacuum will be created.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200912140010-chan-yin-lam-cctv-2-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conspiracy city</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chan will be featured in the surveillance video starting September 19, 2019.

When news emerged that she had participated in several protests earlier this summer, allegations circulated online - without evidence - that officers attacked or raped Chan, killed him and threw his body into the harbor.<br />\r\nSpeculation about Chan&#39;s death continued even after his mother publicly said she believed her daughter committed suicide and asked people to stop focusing on the case.<br />\r\nBut instead of putting a stop to the conspiracy theories, Chan&#39;s mother was consumed by them instead. He said he was overwhelmed by phone calls and online harassment, was accused of being an actor, or was in any way allied with the police to cover up his own daughter&#39;s murder.<br />\r\n&quot;My personal information is published online. I was plagued by phone calls in the middle of the night,&quot; Chan&#39;s mother said in an interview with a Hong Kong television operator last year. &quot;I lost my daughter, please stop persecuting me. It&#39;s too hard for us ... Please leave our family alone. I want my daughter to rest in peace.&quot;<br />\r\nThe Chan family could not be identified for this story.

In an increasingly paranoid environment, he added, &quot;People in Hong Kong who are already skeptical may believe that Chan&#39;s parents were paid by the state to lie about their daughter&#39;s death.&quot;<br />\r\nWhen he appeared in court last month, Chan&#39;s mother was persecuted again. The audience screamed and accused her of being an actress. According to police, two people, a 17-year-old boy and a 65-year-old woman, were arrested and charged with rioting.<br />\r\nStill, the Chan family members weren&#39;t the only ones facing the fallout.<br />\r\nWhen the Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI), where Chan studied, initially refused to release all the footage from the night of his death, students smashed the school, smashed windows and windows, smashed cameras and sprayed graffiti. Although HKDI ended up releasing more videos showing Chan&#39;s movements even when he left campus, some claimed that the school was actively covering up, and even said that the girl who appeared in the video was an actress. past.<br />\r\nPerhaps more than anything else, this HKDI surveillance footage has drawn media and public attention to Chan&#39;s case.<br />\r\nThe sight of Chan walking aimlessly around HKDI through the Hong Kong Island port, knowing that this will be one of the last times he is seen alive, is haunting. It was hard not to look for the signs of what he thought was coming.<br />\r\nIn 16 videos shot over nearly 90 minutes on the evening of September 19, Chan - wearing a black tank top and wide black and white striped trousers - looks confused or confused, but not overly angry. Her short brown hair was pulled back from her face and she shook hands in front of him as she walked as soon as she stopped and appeared to be counting on her fingers. He didn&#39;t see the phone or speak to anyone on the tape.<br />\r\nHe is seen walking around the campus for over an hour, waiting for elevators, walking off rooftops and through dining rooms where other students huddle on laptops or have dinner. At some point she threw away her bag and then her shoes and continued walking barefoot.<br />\r\nAt around 7:00 p.m., Chan appeared to be leaving campus. A witness investigating his death testified that he saw him enter a nearby subway station, but he did not pass through the ticket gates. What happened between that time and the discovery of his body three days later is unknown.<br />\r\nBut while these gaps in official records haunt many observers, the whole story of Chan&#39;s death begins much earlier.<br />\r\nThe evidence presented during the August 11 investigation paints a picture of an increasingly anxious young woman who, despite many options, appears to have slipped through the cracks in getting the help she needs.<br />\r\nPrior to his death, Chan lived with his grandfather but was closely related to his mother, who said the couple were &quot;like sisters&quot;. He had no contact with his father, who is a drug addict, and beat him, the court ruled.<br />\r\nChan was an outstanding student and began to struggle pedagogically since early 2019. He moved quickly and consistently to a number of schools. His grades drop and he gets into a fight with other students.<br />\r\nShe started missing for a long time, the court heard, and in March 2019 she had a confrontation with the police and she was taken to a state orphanage. There he tried to strangle himself with a plastic bag, hit his head against the wall, listened to the court, and forced officials to send him to the hospital.<br />\r\nThis was one of Chan&#39;s many interactions with medical professionals, according to evidence filed in court. She told doctors that she sometimes hears voices, but denied that she had attempted suicide. The doctor who examined her felt she was suffering from acute stress disorder but could not make her agree to a follow-up examination. However, the responsible social worker rejected the incident as an attempt to get out of the youth&#39;s house. Chan&#39;s thoughts were strengthened by the fact that they were discharged in front of the hospital and disappeared within a few weeks, the court heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, Chan reappeared and expressed his desire to change his life. She wants to enroll in a design course at HKDI and is looking for part time work. When the protests started that summer, Chan participated but remained on the fringes, his mother told the investigation.<br />\r\nAround this time, the court heard that he had also started contacting a boy named Wu, who was being held at the Tong Fuk Correctional Center on Lantau Island in western Hong Kong. He later described him as a friend and would visit him with Wu&#39;s father, the court heard.<br />\r\nTwo days after she shed tears at Tsim Sha Tsui on August 12, police were called to the Lantau Subway Station, where Chan screamed and screamed with great difficulty and said that she had lost her cellphone and must have a father of hers. Call a friend. The police said they refused to help the staff who then left.<br />\r\nFinally, Wu&#39;s father arrived at the train station and took Chan to a nearby restaurant. There he continued to act strangely, talking to people at other tables and ordering food that was not on the menu. After she left, she said she would return, but instead returned to the detention center, where Ms. Wu was detained, the court heard.<br />\r\nHe slept in front of the building at night and tried to get in in the morning to confront the staff. As a result, he was handcuffed and taken to a nearby police station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a follow-up visit to the doctor, Chan said again that he heard voices and was very happy. She was taken back to the youth&#39;s home, where she began injuring herself again, destroying her room and banging her head against the wall, the court heard. He was then taken to Castle Peak Hospital, a mental health facility where staff said he had problems controlling him and had to be detained at some point.<br />\r\nChan refused to return to the young man&#39;s house, saying he heard voices while he was there and complained that he wasn&#39;t sleeping. A doctor reassured him, but dismissed his complaint as an indication he was &quot;a rebel,&quot; the court heard.<br />\r\nThis will be the last chance for an intervention that could save Chan&#39;s life.<br />\r\nAfter the investigation, the jury recommended that the hospital administration reconsider continuing care after a psychiatric consultation with a juvenile patient.<br />\r\nThe Hong Kong Ministry of Social Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Castle Peak Hospital said it had &quot;recorded the coroner&#39;s verdict&quot; and &quot;reviewed the jury&#39;s recommendations.&quot; In late August and through September, Chan&#39;s behavior was largely normal, according to the court. He returned home and immediately enrolled in HKDI where he became a friend and seemed to be enjoying the class.<br />\r\nHowever, on September 19, the situation got worse again. At 3 a.m., his grandfather testified in court while Chan was cleaning his room. She said she heard voices and couldn&#39;t sleep. Later that day, at HKDI, he took off his shoes and lay on the floor for an hour, using his backpack as a pillow, the court heard.<br />\r\nAfter class, Chan told his friends that he wanted to clean his locker. He spent nearly half an hour doing this before his friends persuaded him to go with them. When they got on the train at Tiu Keng Leng Station, Chan said he would come back to school later to continue cleaning. He refused to sit on the subway instead of sitting on the floor.<br />\r\nFinally Chan left his friends and said he was on his way home. Instead, he returned to HKDI, where he would spend the last hours of his life, before going to a nearby beach park, according to evidence presented in the investigation.<br />\r\nWhat actually happened next is not clear to point out the critical vacuum in scrutiny and testimony that ultimately left the jury unable to condemn.<br />\r\nDuring the investigation, forensic psychiatrist Robin Ho said Chan&#39;s behavior before his death showed signs of a possible psychotic breakthrough. Ho&#39;s assessment appears to be supported by Chan&#39;s complaints about hearing voices, his inability to sleep - which may also be contributing - and his obsession with order.<br />\r\nThe state of decomposition meant that it was impossible to determine the cause of Chan&#39;s death. But pathologist Garik Lee, who performed the autopsy, said that although he could not confirm, there was a &quot;clear possibility&quot; that he was drowning.<br />\r\nAn investigation found Chan was naked when he entered the water, an interpretation the jury agreed to in their ruling. According to court reports, a strong swimmer was unlikely to have chosen this method of committing suicide, but while in the middle of a psychotic episode on a hot summer&#39;s night, he was convinced that he had made the decision to go swimming. with fatal consequences.<br />\r\nExaminer David Co. instructed the jury and ruled out suicide and &quot;illegal murder&quot; as possible causes of Chan&#39;s death. He said there wasn&#39;t enough evidence of any punishment without a doubt - the legal standard. When her body was found, there were no obvious signs of bruising or injury, as well as signs of sexual abuse or rape, although pathologists admit that these marks may have disappeared while they were in the water.<br />\r\nKo asks the jury to assess whether Chan could have died in an accident or to make an open judgment, essentially admitting that the truth cannot be fully established. Therefore, the jury cited insufficient forensic evidence about how exactly Chan died and whether a mental disorder or disorder caused his death.<br />\r\nA diatom test comparing levels of certain types of microalgae in the victim&#39;s water, lungs, and blood may indicate that the victim is drowning. However, such a test was not carried out in Hong Kong. The jury recommended that a diatom test be performed if there is suspicion of future drowning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200912135938-chan-yin-lam-cctv-1-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tragic consequences</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On its own, Chan&#39;s death was the tragedy of a young woman who showed signs of mental distress and who might have been saved if she had received the right help at the right time.<br />\r\nTo date, the conspiracy surrounding Chan&#39;s death has largely obscured the important question of whether the various agencies and institutions he worked for, from doctors to social workers, failed to help or even realized he needed help. . His death also highlights broader problems with mental health regulations in Hong Kong, especially for young people.<br />\r\nSince 2015, when a series of teenage suicides resulted in a public call for action, the government has increased funding to support mental health. However, experts warn that loopholes remain and the social stigma associated with identifying mental illness may prevent people from seeking help.<br />\r\nThe political unrest has exacerbated pressure on young people in Hong Kong who already face heavy pressure to do well in school, as well as the fact that a shrinking job market and housing squeeze can make it difficult for them to climb the ladder.<br />\r\nFor some young people, Yip, the HKU expert, said the protest movement may have saved their lives and provided the sense of community and solidarity they might need when someone is most vulnerable.<br />\r\nHowever, he is deeply concerned about how Chan and several other movement-related deaths have been turned into so-called &quot;martyrs&quot;. He said doing so was a risk of copying copies - even if the person might not have killed themselves. Purposely.<br />\r\n&quot;Every death by suicide is a very tragic case for us. We have to handle them very carefully, not feeling them, not trying to glorify them,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n&quot;When people feel so helpless, they may think that when I die, I can evoke so much emotion and energy and feed the movement itself (protest), which is very tempting.&quot;<br />\r\nHe blamed part of the long delay between Chan&#39;s death and the forensic doctor&#39;s examination for making room for the conspiracy to spread. And he fears that future cases where confusion or lack of evidence about how someone died could be equally affected.<br />\r\nYam, a professor at the University of Kentucky, said that &quot;mental illness, especially depression, anxiety and PTSD, is increasing and continues to be a stigma among Hong Kong residents.&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;This stigma, coupled with the public&#39;s propensity for anti-government conspiracy theories, could result in a significant public health crisis in Hong Kong in which people cannot access mental health care,&quot; he added, which was mostly supported by the government or government. Provided by government-affiliated agencies.<br />\r\nIn the end, he attributed the problems to protests, particularly &quot;lack of police accountability and transparency&quot;.<br />\r\nAnd this lack of trust goes beyond the police and calling for all government action, no matter how many officials insist that their actions are in the public interest.<br />\r\nWhen authorities announced mass voluntary testing for the coronavirus this month, some saw it as a way to collect DNA samples from residents, or samples in Beijing sent by medics to help drive. The initial delay in closing Hong Kong&#39;s border on mainland China in the early months of the pandemic is also seen as politically tense, even as countries around the world struggle to respond in a timely manner.<br />\r\nIn short, Chan&#39;s coroner expressed his condolences for his family, especially his mother. Before he died, Chan was finally able to find out what he wanted and was kind to his friends and family.<br />\r\n&quot;Despite the controversy, I believe (Chan) treats you well,&quot; the judge told his mother, adding that he hoped the family would find a way to normalize over time.<br />\r\nAs Chan&#39;s case shows, Hong Kong itself may find it more difficult to achieve such normalcy.</p>', 'Hong Kong, Death', 'Hongkong teenager death_1600590725.jpg', '2020-09-20 12:32:05', '2021-08-12 00:10:57'),

And while the exact course of action isn&#39;t detailed, Democrats say they agree on the issue: they plan to join the fight to stop running by urging the four Republicans to break ranks.<br />\r\n&quot;Mitch McConnell believes this fight is over. What Mitch McConnell doesn&#39;t understand is that this fight has just started,&quot; Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said at an event in Ginsburg on Saturday.<br />\r\nFirst, Democrats want to stop running and are considering an unusual move to fill the entire Senate business to get the case backwards as long as possible, senators said. Under a rule that requires the Council to work unanimously, Democrats can reject day-to-day business, essentially stopping the Council.<br />\r\nMcConnell can eventually bypass such tactics at the booth if he has the support of 51 Senators, but they can expand production.<br />\r\nAnd if Democrats ultimately can&#39;t stop the candidates, they can pass a bill to expand the Supreme Court by adding extra seats to retaliate for what they perceive to be a tough Republican tactic.<br />\r\nIt&#39;s an option that has attracted increasing interest since Ginsburg&#39;s death - and one that Democratic leaders have not ruled out.<br />\r\n&quot;Basically we left the options open,&quot; Senate minority Dick Durbin told CNN host Anna Cabrera on Saturday evening when she was asked to add more seats in the court.<br />\r\n&quot;We prefer this through the regular process that Senator (Mitch) McConnell announced four years ago, and that all Republicans come forward and believe in this approach: we do not fill in any gaps about the Colonel in the final year of the Court&#39;s presidency,&quot; he said. Durbin related to the mood of the 2016 GOP Senator to fill the vacancies for the Supreme Court.<br />\r\nMcConnell promised on Friday that whoever nominates Trump as Ginsburg&#39;s representative will vote in the Senate, arguing that the situation is now different from 2016 because Republicans control the Senate and the White House.<br />\r\nThe subject of how the Democrats should react, according to Democratic sources, was the dominant topic at Saturday afternoon&#39;s Democratic Council conference at which many Democratic senators discussed the events and where minority leader Chuck Schumer warned, &quot;There&#39;s nothing about this. . The table &quot;if the Trump candidate is confirmed this election year.<br />\r\nSumer said Friday that the Supreme Court post &quot;must not be filled until we have a new president&quot;.<br />\r\nHowever, several things must happen for Democrats to successfully implement their approach to expanding the Supreme Court.<br />\r\nFirst, the Senate Democrats must win a majority by November - and the battle for control of the assembly is now on the brink of a razor. If they win a majority, that&#39;s almost certainly a very narrow advantage - maybe a seat or two, or even a 50:50 Senate. And if Biden wins the presidency, they will have to take a number of steps to make the expansion of the Supreme Court a reality.<br />\r\nThis then includes wiping out the filibuster, a stoppage tactic often used by minority Senate parties that require 60 votes in the House to overcome. You need a simple majority of Senators to lower that threshold to 51.<br />\r\nHowever, some Democratic senators have firmly spoken out against the filibuster killings because of concerns it could have long-term consequences for institutions and the state.<br />\r\nUltimately, an additional seat on the Supreme Court will receive legislation as soon as it is amended, which would be a highly controversial move even in the Senate House of Representatives.</p>', 'Senate Democrats, Gop', 'Senate Democrates_1600590977.jpg', '2020-09-20 12:36:17', '2021-08-17 18:09:40'),

Is there anything you think you can do when you try to get re-elected for the next 50 days?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200704115055-xi-putin-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nAnd if &quot;no&quot; is the answer to those two questions, then the 75 days of possible chaos and strife that followed pre-election elections offer another chance. In the White House, no one is likely to be behind the wheel, not underneath, fighting for their car keys. Is this also a window for competitors to do something about?<br />\r\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is a more skilled pragmatist and opportunist, despite the biggest gains in Trump&#39;s four-year term. His first term in office allowed Putin to make significant gains in the Middle East, something the Kremlin is doing with little US opposition and fanfare for Russia&#39;s own achievements.<br />\r\nHowever, it is important to remember that Russia&#39;s clashes with US patrols in Syria and a conspiracy to reward Russia for killing Americans in Afghanistan have been largely indisputable over the past six months. The Kremlin will likely not only be brave, but also carefully calculate what the next 120 days will likely be.<br />\r\nThe protest movement against Belarus&#39; brutal dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, is an uninvited but pressing topic on Putin&#39;s list. Russia has sent journalists, maybe technical support, maybe even some security forces to help Lukashenko. But he&#39;s still hesitant and is a bad bet in the long run because he betrayed his pathetic body language when he met Putin in Sochi. It&#39;s hard to overstate how important it is for Moscow to maintain control of Belarus, and how important it is to this protest movement - about the personal freedoms that utterly disappointed Putin, and not about the geopolitics on which it is nationalist. excited - failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200909140646-belarus-rally-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nBelarus is also at the bottom of the US agenda. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been slowly supporting the protest movement - perhaps in his slim defense - after trying to seduce Lukashenko in hopes of turning him west.<br />\r\nThe Kremlin certainly does not accept the idea of ​​years of supporting a leader they consider too weak to crush their own dissidents and too unpopular to challenge. Lukashenko is a costly predicament and they will likely plan to break free while forcing a closer alliance between Moscow and Minsk. The protests themselves will be a thorn to the side - unpredictable and indolent - if Putin believes a troubled Washington may not be able to respond to the next steps. Somewhat surprising that Putin has not installed a more flexible US government since 2017. Ambitious, capable and skillful, he has subtly pursued his goals over the past four years. That can change.<br />\r\nSubtlety is not seen in the &quot;maximum pressure&quot; the Trump administration is exerting on Iran. You may be forgiven for claiming success. Trump killed Iran&#39;s greatest formidable leader, Qassem Soleimani, in January in an act that many fear could set the region on fire. In fact, no. Tehran has withdrawn from low-level retaliation, and Trump recently tweeted in response to press reports that US diplomats could risk revenge 1,000 times harsher.<br />\r\nSanctions will be tightened almost to their elastic limit. And Covid-19 is hitting Iran hard. Mysterious fires have engulfed the Natanz nuclear power plant and other critical infrastructure. Even so, it would be wrong to believe that this erases the long and extraordinary memories of Tehran&#39;s solid ships. Internally, their hands had been strengthened in many ways by the collapse of the nuclear deal they hated. Trump also gave them gifts for breaking up. Five years ago, the world was united behind the JCPOA&#39;s ability to contain Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions. The Europeans are now holding their heads as Trump shreds the deal, while Russia and China view Washington in confusion and demean their own allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200815190816-03-trump-bedminster-press-conference-0815-exlarge-169.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; width:100%\" /><br />\r\nAnd during this collapse, Iran is methodically and slowly fulfilling its promise of getting rich again. In public, they went beyond the terms of the contract, but still weren&#39;t competing for 20% enrichment, which would ring an alarm bell. The IAEA now believes it has enriched uranium ten times as much, but has also said positively that it could inspect a second suspicious site in the coming weeks.<br />\r\nThe wisdom of the western capital is that Iran understands the consequences of a bomb so heavy that outweigh its benefits. There is a paradox that the revenge new nuclear energy could be calmer. And in the Gulf world, Iran has not reacted, knows that Trump does not want a new war in the Middle East and is patient.<br />\r\nTrump&#39;s most important ally, one of the few to pursue goals that run counter to US interests, was impatient after a personal interview with Turkey-based White House President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It seems that it has been a decade since its forces invaded Syria, attacked American ally Syrian Kurds and relocated American forces in full force. But that was over a year ago.<br />\r\nSince then, Turkey has consolidated its profits there and is busy elsewhere. He briefly swung his sword around the Greek islands. More importantly, Erdogan is investing political and military capital to support the Libyan government with the support of the United Nations. According to US authorities, Russia is saddling its opponents in the oil-rich East with Wagner&#39;s mercenaries, heavy armor, missiles and other means. Peace talks are ongoing but under a cloud of intense build-up on both sides.<br />\r\nPresidents Putin and Erdogan may see America&#39;s neutrality in Libya and Trump&#39;s busy days as reasons to act if talks stall.<br />\r\nPresidents Putin and Erdogan may see America&#39;s neutrality in Libya and Trump&#39;s busy days as reasons to act if talks stall.<br />\r\nPutin and Erdogan have celebrated their growing friendship despite Turkey being a member of NATO. Now the glow of his smile had disappeared. And Moscow has a long history of peace because it makes war more assertive. Both Putin and Erdogan can see American neutrality in Libya and Trump&#39;s busy days as reasons to act if talks fail.<br />\r\nThe next 120 days will be held hostage by reliance on the unrest of the past four years, myths about intense but ultimately imperfect personal relationships between Trump and other leaders, and the nature of the White House foreign policy impasse. US politics can face crises that have long been predicted and even trigger crises of its opponents. Even so, the world will not stop, and I hope this crisis is resolved, but it continues to spin in ways the obsessed White House does not expect.</p>', 'US Elections, October Surprise', 'trumps_1600593665.jpg', '2020-09-20 13:21:05', '2021-09-23 08:15:52'),

Protest leaders say it is a replacement for another plaque that marked the end of monarchy in 1932 but disappeared in 2017.<br />\r\nThai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha thanked officials and everyone who worked together to end the situation peacefully on Sunday, his spokesman Anucha Burapachaysri said in a statement. .<br />\r\n&quot;Both the protesters and the officials avoided confrontation and incitement, which could create an unnecessary tense situation,&quot; the statement said.<br />\r\n&quot;The government intends to allow people to exercise their constitutional rights legally.&quot;<br />\r\nAsked to hand over the reform letter to the king, Burapachaisri said: &quot;I learned of your demands for monarchical reform when I heard your speech on stage, but I don&#39;t have the details yet.

They also gathered on campus in Sanam Luang, a public square near the official residence of the king at the Grand Palace.<br />\r\nThis comes after two months of nearly daily demonstrations, including one in Bangkok with around 10,000 people on 16 August. The movement started with students in cities across the country - but has since attracted a large proportion of the public.<br />\r\nProtesters and their supporters are calling for a series of institutional changes; For example, Pita Limjaroenrat of Napred&#39;s opposition party said that his faction would propose a council meeting to &quot;rewrite the constitution peacefully&quot;.<br />\r\nAnti-government protesters break through the gates of Tamasat University when they attend a democracy rally in Bangkok on Sept. 19.<br />\r\nThe best solution, said Limiaroenrat, is to select a &quot;group of people&quot; to rewrite. He told the media that if the country does not change, &quot;people will continue to take to the streets&quot;.<br />\r\nHowever, among these complaints, reform of the monarchy was the main demand. In an earlier protest on August 10, Panusaya read a series of calls for palace reform, including securing a real constitutional monarchy that places the king under a constitution.<br />\r\nThis is a radical idea in Thailand, where powerful royal institutions are viewed with godlike admiration by many - but discontent, especially among Thai youth, has simmered over the years.<br />\r\nOver the years resistance grew<br />\r\nThailand has been experiencing political turmoil for years. The military coup in 2014 was followed by failed promises to restore democracy and, according to activists, the suppression of civil rights and freedoms.<br />\r\nActivists say they are fed up with injustices such as the constitution that continues to hold on to power, the protracted coronavirus emergency - which they believe serves to suppress political opposition and free speech - and a shaky economy that leaves them with few job prospects. and the disappearance of democracy activists living in exile.<br />\r\nIn this atmosphere, their anger is now directed at King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne in 2016 and was crowned in May 2019.<br />\r\nSecurity forces are on high alert when anti-government protesters take part in protests in Bangkok on September 19.<br />\r\nVajiralongkorn is believed to have spent most of his time abroad and largely absent from public life in Thailand as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.<br />\r\nSince he became king, billions of assets held by the Thai crown have been transferred to Vajiralongkorn, strengthening his control over the king&#39;s finances and significantly increasing his personal wealth.<br />\r\nThe Crown Property Act, passed in 1936, rearranged Thai royal family property into a separate category for royal property.

By measuring how long it took these slow-moving signals to cross water from Indonesia to a monitoring station on Diego Garcia Island, they were able to determine 10 years of temperature changes in the oceans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It takes about half an hour of sound waves from Sumatra to Diego Garcia,&quot; said lead author Dr. Wenbo Wu of the California Institute of Technology told the news channel. &quot;Changes in temperature in the deep sea between Sumatra and Diego Garcia cause this half hour travel time to vary by tenths of a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Because we can measure these fluctuations very precisely, we can infer small changes in mean deep ocean temperature, in this case about a tenth of a degree.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors say the system has several significant advantages in that it can provide large average temperatures for 3,000 kilometers from Sumatra to Diego Garcia, reducing the impact of local fluctuations and increasing accuracy over the oceans like a hole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This method is also quite inexpensive because it uses the collected data and is sensitive to temperatures lower than the 2000 m current limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their research, the scientists showed that the warming in the Indian Ocean was greater than previously calculated over the decades they studied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this paper has several important limitations. &quot;It is important to emphasize that these are results that can be applied in specific areas and this decade,&quot; said Dr. Wu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have to apply our methods across more regions and in different time frames to assess whether global deep ocean trends are systematically underestimated or overestimated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s too early to draw conclusions in that direction.&quot; For their ideas to be applied worldwide, scientists need access to more underwater receivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research team is currently working on data from the UN Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Organization&#39;s hydrophone network, which listens for underwater nuclear explosions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hydrophone picks up the signals of the 10,000 shallow underwater earthquakes that occur around the world each year, said Dr. Wu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All of this data contains information about changes in temperature in the deep ocean - it&#39;s just waiting to be extracted.&quot;</p>', 'Climate Change, Earth Quake', 'Temprature_1600602464.jpg', '2020-09-20 15:47:44', '2021-12-19 17:32:17'),

He&#39;s deliberately minimized the danger it postures to Americans, pushed informal medicines, and guaranteed the nation that immunization would show up quickly. In pre-recorded comments at the yearly Al Smith Dinner on Thursday night, Trump guaranteed that &quot;the finish of the pandemic is in sight, and one year from now will be probably the best year throughout the entire existence of our nation.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hours after the fact, soon after <strong>1 a.m. Friday</strong> morning on the East Coast, Trump declared that both he and first woman Melania Trump had tried positive for Covid-19. That analysis made Trump&#39;s procedure of changing the subject in these last 32 days before the political decision from Covid-19 to, well, whatever else, absolutely unimaginable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump will presently be compelled to isolate for about fourteen days, taking him off the battlefield and likely constraining the rescheduling - if not through and through crossing out of, at any rate, the second presidential discussion, which was set for October 15 in Miami, Florida. (The solitary bad habit presidential discussion is on the timetable for next Wednesday in Salt Lake City; Vice President Mike Pence tried negative for Covid-19 on Friday morning, as per his office.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That, all by itself, is a significant hit to a <strong>President</strong> who is a) following previous Vice President Joe Biden in public and swing-state surveying and b) sees his mission rallies - huge, rowdy issues - as the soul of his mission as well as his administration. Despite the continuous infection danger, Trump had expanded the recurrence of his mission travel throughout the most recent couple of months as he looked to promise the nation that the battle against the infection was being won and that the opportunity had arrived to proceed onward to different issues - most quite, as per Trump from the platform, the fierce fights occurring in urban areas around the nation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://news-zilla.com/uploads/ckeditor/12_1601669587.jpg\" style=\"height:50%; margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:20px; width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has likewise effectively spurned accepted procedures with regards to easing back the spread of the infection. Notwithstanding direction from the CDC - starting in April - that veil wearing is one of the main (and most ideal) approaches to battle Covid-19&#39;s irresistibleness, the President has not just communicated distrust about the need to wear covers yet has likewise ridiculed Biden for doing as such.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trade, among Trump and presidential discussion mediator Chris Wallace, from Tuesday night, exemplifies how Trump has moved toward veil wearing:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wallace: President Trump, you have started to progressively scrutinize the adequacy of covers as an infection preventer. Furthermore, truth be told, as of late you have referred to the issue of - of servers contacting their veils and contacting plates. Is it true that you are scrutinizing the viability of veils?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump: No, I believe that covers are OK. You need to comprehend if you look - I mean, I have a veil here. I put a veil on, you know when I think I need it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This evening, for instance, everyone&#39;s had a test and you&#39;ve had social separating and everything that you need to, yet -&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden: Just like your assemblies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump: - I wear covers when required. At the point when required, I wear veils.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wallace: OK, allowed me to ask -&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump: I don&#39;t have - I don&#39;t wear veils like him. Each time you see him, he has a cover. He could be talking 200 feet from them and he appears with the greatest veil I&#39;ve ever observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more, as per the pool correspondent going with Trump to and from the discussion, &quot;all relatives who entered without a veil, individuals from his organization and different visitors were not wearing covers.&quot; A specialist associated with the Cleveland Clinic moved toward the gathering offering covers if they didn&#39;t have them. Nobody in the gathering put on a cover. Likewise, previous New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on ABC News Friday morning that &quot;nobody was wearing covers in the room when we were preparing the President during that timeframe, the gathering was around 5 or 6 individuals altogether.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the positive trial of the President and first woman demonstrate (and, all the more precisely, re-demonstrate) is that the COVID couldn&#39;t care less whether you trust in it or not. It taints Democrats, Republicans, and individuals who don&#39;t follow or think about governmental issues. Disregarding it or imagining it is showing signs of improvement - notwithstanding information that proposes we have never, truly, gotten over the primary wave - doesn&#39;t influence whether it can nauseate you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was consistently a truly begging to be proven wrong recommendation with regards to whether Trump&#39;s endeavors to make this political decision about &quot;peace&quot; or communism or, well, whatever he tweeted that day would be fruitful in the midst of the consistent walk of the infection in the nation. (As of Friday morning, 7.3 million Americans had been determined to have Covid-19 and 208,000 had been killed by the illness). Many surveys proposed that the infection and the economy, which has been vigorously influenced by the closures and log jams brought about by the infection, were (and are) the two most significant issues in the nation. Also, the early signs on Friday recommended that the financial recuperation from the underlying hit of Covid-19 had eased back; The economy included 661,000 positions in September, with the joblessness rate stuck at 7.9%. (That is the most noteworthy joblessness rate this late in a presidential political race since at any rate 1948.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commonsense effects of Trump&#39;s finding are not kidding. Yet, the less-substantial effects might be considerably more exorbitant to a President who has banked his re-appointment on the possibility that things are getting a whole lot better and doing so incredibly, rapidly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump&#39;s conduct - consistent travel, absence of veil wearing, introduction to parts and heaps of individuals - consistently made him more probable than the normal individual to get the ailment, the way that he currently has it will constrain a recalibration for some individuals. Furthermore, that recalibration will revolve around this inquiry: If the President of the United States can get Covid-19, I&#39;m not catching that&#39;s meaning for my odds of getting it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That vulnerability - and the tension it causes - is incredible. The infection, which has now been with us for most of a half year, feels all the more genuine and more compromising for some Americans today than it has in numerous months. It&#39;s figured out how to nauseate the most impressive and very much ensured individual in the nation. How individuals respond to the recently discovered newness of the danger - regardless of whether the danger remains generally equivalent to it did precede Trump&#39;s conclusion - is an X factor in the political race, especially given that we are under five weeks from the genuine vote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we can be sure of is that Trump&#39;s endeavor to make these last a long time of the political decision about some different option from the COVID bombed the subsequent he got his positive test back. Link news will cover his disease - and the individuals he came into contact with and whether they are likewise debilitated - one end to the other for quite a long time. While Covid-19 was the lead story for most media sources on most days throughout the previous barely any months, it is probably going to turn into the ONLY story for a long time to come.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short: Everything Trump attempted to keep away from in the stretch run of the 2020 race is presently happening.

In 1964, the Shanghai public transportation system imported Skoda (SKODA) 706RTO diesel passenger cars from the Czech Republic, equipped with 49 roads, and used them until the end of the 1970s. In the 1980s, 49 road set up a &quot;service for you&quot; information desk, the team has won the &quot;National Workers Pioneer&quot; and other titles, for decades has been the pacesetter in the Shanghai public transport system.</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Take this bus line, along the road, you can check in the Bund Scenery Reserve, Fuzhou Road Cultural Street, People&rsquo;s Square, Weihai Road, pass the old building of Minli Middle School, the original Dazhongli plot, as well as Jing&rsquo;an Villa, Sun Apartment, Shanghai Poster Industry Group Famous buildings such as the Shanghai Exhibition Center.

It was the predecessor of Shanghai Bus 71.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On November 1, 1956, the number of Shanghai bus routes was uniformly adjusted, and No. 3 was officially named Shanghai No. 71. Because the line is located on the main road of the city, it runs east-west and runs through the city center.

As soon as the car drew up to the station, passengers rushed up, and the two-story carriages were instantly full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the development of transportation in Shanghai, the functional positioning of Road 911 has gradually changed from commuter cars to sightseeing cars.

Trump&#39;s infection is a symbol of the mess in the United States&#39; fight against the epidemic. As of yesterday, nearly 7.5 million cases have been diagnosed in the United States and nearly 210,000 deaths have been accumulated. The number of Americans who have lost their lives due to the new crown virus is more than twice the number of deaths in the five major US overseas wars after World War II. According to estimates made by the University of Washington, the death toll from the new crown in the United States will double to 400,000 by the end of this year. Many experts believe that the United States, as the number one economic and technological power, has world-class laboratories, scientists, and medical resources, but the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths far exceeds that of other countries, which is puzzling. Fauci, a member of the U.S. anti-epidemic work expert group, said that the number of deaths from the new crown in the United States is &quot;sobering.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even so, Trump gave his anti-epidemic performance an A+, saying that if it were not for his anti-epidemic performance, the number of deaths would be more than that. Since the outbreak of the epidemic in the United States, Trump has always shown advances and retreats on the issue of fighting the epidemic. He has neither implemented sufficient social distancing measures nor has he united domestic forces to fight the epidemic. He even often does not wear masks. Anti-scientific attitudes boasted and even blamed China. For example, claiming that &quot;no one knows the new crown better than me&quot; and said that drinking disinfectant can treat the new crown. Last month, a former staff of Vice President Pence broke out that Trump said &quot;new crown pneumonia or a good thing.&quot; The number of new coronavirus cases in the United States fell to about 20,000 in a single day a month ago. Trump ignored the opposition of local governments, experts, and scholars, and couldn&#39;t wait to ask the states to restart the economy, causing the epidemic to repeat itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, although the Chinese mainland was the first area where the new crown epidemic broke out, under strong prevention and control measures, the epidemic has been effectively controlled in just over two months. People all over the world have seen China&#39;s outstanding performance in anti-epidemic measures, policy implementation, and people&#39;s unity. In particular, the speed of construction of Vulcan Mountain, Thunder Mountain, and Fangcai Hospital shocked the world and demonstrated China&#39;s strength to the world. Many countries have sought help from China, and China is also willing to extend a helping hand, helping Italy, Russia, Venezuela, and other countries to fight the epidemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excellent epidemic control capabilities have made the Mainland one of the very few areas that have successfully controlled local cases near zero new cases. On this basis, the Mainland has the ability to promote economic recovery, with GDP growth of 3.2% in the second quarter, which is one of the best results of major economies in the world. The Mainland is on the National Day Golden Week holiday. The China Tourism Research Institute predicts that 550 million people will travel domestically during this holiday. The resumption rate of accommodation and tourist attractions businesses is expected to reach 100%, and consumption in tourist attractions can recover to 90% of the same period last year. From left to right, it shows that the mainland economy has gradually emerged from the impact of the epidemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third wave of the epidemic has broken out in Hong Kong since July. With the full support of the Central Government and the united efforts of all Hong Kong citizens, the epidemic has only gradually eased in recent days. The central government dispatched a nucleic acid testing support team from the Mainland to assist the SAR government in implementing a community-wide testing program. It also helped to add quarantine and community treatment facilities at the AsiaWorld-Expo, making it the strongest support for Hong Kong to overcome the new crown epidemic.
